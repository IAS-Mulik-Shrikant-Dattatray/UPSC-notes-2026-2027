# Topic : Changes in critical geographical features (including water-bodies and polar ice caps) and, in flora and fauna and the effects of such changes.


**1. Cryosphere and Climate Regulation**

The cryosphere, consisting of ice caps, glaciers, sea ice, and permafrost, is crucial for regulating the climate by reflecting sunlight and influencing ocean currents, which helps maintain global temperatures and water levels. Recently, Venezuela's Humboldt Glacier lost its last glacier, now downgraded to an ice field, due to rising temperatures, El Ni√±o, and local climate changes.
