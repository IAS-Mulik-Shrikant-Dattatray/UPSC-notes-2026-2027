# Topic : Economics of animal-rearing.

**1. Introduction:**  


Animal husbandry involves raising livestock and selective breeding. It is a branch of agricultural science focused on the study and management of domesticated animal breeds to improve products and services. When combined with business practices, this field is known as Livestock Management.

----

**2. Significance of Animal Rearing :** 


Livestock plays a vital role in farmers' economies, especially in India, where mixed farming (combining crops and livestock) enhances resource efficiency. Livestock serves various purposes:

- **Income**  
  - Livestock provides supplementary income for many families, especially those with few animals.  
  - Cows and buffaloes generate regular income through milk sales.  
  - Sheep and goats help during emergencies, such as for weddings, medical expenses, children's education, or house repairs.  
  - Animals also act as assets, offering economic security.

- **Employment**  
  - Agriculture is seasonal, offering work for about 180 days a year. Livestock helps landless or small-scale farmers stay employed during off-seasons.

- **Food**  
  - Livestock products, like milk, meat, and eggs, are key sources of animal protein for livestock owners.

- **Draft**  
  - Bullocks are essential for tasks like ploughing, carting, and transporting goods, especially for small and marginal farmers.

- **Animal Waste**  
  - In rural areas, dung is used for fuel (dung cakes), fertilizer (farmyard manure), and plastering material.

- **Social Functions**  
  - Livestock offers social security, enhancing the status of owners, especially landless families.  
  - Animals are often gifted during weddings and used in various socio-religious rituals, such as worshiping cows and bulls.

**Livestock-based Integrated Farming System (IFS): Overview**

**Integrated Farming System (IFS):**
IFS is an agricultural approach where multiple, interdependent, and often interrelated production systems (such as crops, animals, and subsidiary enterprises) are combined to maximize nutrient utilization and minimize environmental impact. It involves using the outputs from one system as inputs for another, creating a mutually beneficial cycle of production.

**Livestock-based IFS:**
Livestock-based IFS incorporates livestock raising, crop farming, and sometimes fish culture. For example, in **fish-cum-pig farming**, the waste from pigs is used as manure to nourish zooplankton and phytoplankton in a pond, which, in turn, serve as nutrients for fish. The pond's biomass-rich bottom soil is then used for crops or vegetables.

---

**Benefits of Livestock-based IFS:**

1. **Increased Productivity:**
   - IFS intensifies crop and allied activities, boosting **yields per unit area** and enhancing overall productivity.

2. **Sustainability:**
   - Waste recycling from different systems in IFS increases **sustainability**, minimizes environmental pollution, and optimizes resource use.

3. **Balanced Nutrition:**
   - IFS ensures a **diverse range of food** production (crops, livestock, eggs, milk, etc.), providing small-scale farmers with a balanced and varied diet.

4. **Profitability:**
   - By reducing input costs through resource sharing (e.g., using livestock waste for crops), IFS lowers the cost of production and boosts farmers' **purchasing power**.

5. **Income Stability:**
   - Livestock-based IFS offers **year-round income** from multiple sources such as crops, meat, milk, and eggs, ensuring stable cash flow for farmers.

6. **Employment Generation:**
   - The combination of crops and livestock increases labor demand, helping to reduce **underemployment** in rural areas.

7. **Energy Savings:**
   - Cattle dung can be used as a **biomass energy source**, reducing dependency on fossil fuels like petrol and diesel.

8. **Fodder Availability:**
   - Crop by-products and waste are effectively repurposed as **fodder** for livestock, addressing fodder shortages.

---

**Conclusion:**
Livestock-based IFS is a sustainable, efficient, and profitable agricultural model. It has been traditionally practiced in India, especially in the North-Eastern region, and has the potential to be expanded nationwide. By promoting integrated, closed-cycle farming, IFS can help achieve higher productivity, environmental sustainability, and improved livelihoods, contributing to the goal of doubling farmers’ income and fostering sustainable development in developing countries.

**Poor Quality and Inadequate Availability of Feeds and Fodder: Impact on Livestock Productivity in India**

**Introduction:**
Livestock plays a significant role in India's agricultural economy, with cattle, buffaloes, goats, and sheep being integral to rural livelihoods. However, despite the large livestock population, **productivity** in India remains low. For example, the average annual productivity of cattle in India is 1777 kg per animal, which is considerably lower than the global average of 2699 kg per animal per year. The main factors contributing to this low productivity are intrinsic issues like genetic limitations and extrinsic factors such as poor nutrition, poor feed management, ineffective veterinary care, and inadequate feed and fodder.

---

**Quality and Availability of Feeds and Fodder:**
The **availability and quality of feed and fodder** are critical in determining the productivity of livestock. According to the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, there is a significant shortfall in the availability of key feed resources:
- **Dry fodder**: There is a deficit of 23.4% in dry fodder availability.
- **Green fodder**: A shortfall of 11.24% exists.
- **Concentrates**: A deficit of 28.9% has been reported for concentrates (protein-rich feed).

The lack of sufficient, high-quality feed is one of the primary reasons behind low productivity in the sector.

---

**Reasons for Poor Quality and Shortage of Feed and Fodder:**

1. **Pressure on Land:**
   - The land area dedicated to **fodder cultivation** has remained stagnant at around 4% of the total cropping area. This is due to the increasing demand for food grains, oilseeds, and pulses, along with declining land size and encroachment on grazing lands. As a result, livestock mainly depend on **crop residues** (which make up more than 44% of the feed) that are low in nutritional value, high in fiber, and deficient in essential nutrients like crude protein.

2. **Issues with Crop Residues and Dry Fodder:**
   - Farmers are increasingly using **high-yielding dwarf crop varieties** (such as wheat, maize, and sorghum), which produce less straw. Moreover, **straw** is often diverted for use in industries like paper production or for brick-making. Additionally, **straw-burning** is a widespread practice, further reducing the availability of dry fodder.

3. **Price Volatility:**
   - The prices of **feed ingredients** are highly volatile, leading feed manufacturers to substitute cheaper ingredients, which often compromise the quality of the feed. This adversely impacts the health and productivity of the livestock.

4. **Limited Adoption of Improved Fodder Varieties:**
   - Farmers are often unaware of or lack access to **improved fodder varieties**. The absence of an assured market for fodder crops discourages adoption, and as a result, farmers rely on traditional, often low-quality fodder varieties.

---

**Measures to Improve Quality and Quantity of Fodder:**

1. **Cooperatives and Grazing Lands:**
   - Establishing **fodder cooperatives** and increasing the area of **common grazing lands** can help ensure a consistent and adequate supply of feed and fodder for livestock. This can be especially helpful in regions with limited private land.

2. **Integrated Farming Systems (IFS):**
   - Implementing **silvi-pastoral** (combining forestry and pasture) and **horti-pastoral** models can substantially increase fodder production. Additionally, unused farmland areas can be converted into **fodder production zones**, improving the overall availability of feed.

3. **Buffer Stocks and Fodder Banks:**
   - **Community fodder banks** can be established where surplus fodder is stored as **hay, silage, or fodder blocks** for use during scarcity periods. This can help manage fodder availability in times of shortage, particularly during droughts.

4. **Support for Farmers:**
   - Providing **credit facilities**, **assured markets**, and **forward and backward linkages** for fodder production can incentivize farmers to produce high-quality fodder. Additionally, promoting **fodder production** through initiatives like **fodder producer organizations (FPOs)** can help address the supply-demand gap.

5. **Government Initiatives:**
   - The government has recognized the importance of **fodder production** and has initiated measures such as using **MGNREGA** (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) funds to develop **fodder farms**. There are also plans to promote **quality fodder seeds** and link **fodder deficit states** with those producing surplus fodder.

---

**Conclusion:**
The poor quality and inadequate availability of feeds and fodder are major contributors to low livestock productivity in India. To address this, it is essential to implement strategies like fostering **cooperatives**, adopting **integrated farming systems**, establishing **fodder banks**, and supporting farmers through financial incentives and education. With the increasing demand for livestock products and the rising livestock population, ensuring a consistent supply of quality feed and fodder is crucial for enhancing productivity and sustaining the growth of India's livestock sector.

2. **Dairy Cooperatives:**
   - Women are increasingly involved in **dairy cooperatives**, with **31% of all dairy cooperative members** being women as of 2020-21. The number of women’s dairy cooperative societies grew from 18,954 in 2012 to 32,092 in 2015-16, and the number of women members rose from **5 million** in 2015-16 to **5.4 million** in 2020-21.
   
3. **Daily Livestock Care:**
   - Women are primarily responsible for the **care and management** of livestock. They are involved in tasks such as:
     - **Milking** ewes and cows.
     - Providing **feed**, **fodder**, and **water** to the animals.
     - **Caring for newborn lambs/kids** and sick animals.
     - **Grazing** goats and sheep, especially by young girls.
   
4. **Ownership and Livestock Management:**
   - **Livestock ownership**, particularly small stock and poultry, is often more **equitable** for women than other assets like land or capital. Women in rural areas tend to have more control over livestock compared to land, making it an important asset for their economic empowerment.

---

**Issues Faced by Women in the Livestock Sector in India:**

1. **Lack of Gender-Disaggregated Data:**
   - There is a lack of reliable **data on women’s participation** in the livestock sector. Surveys like the **Periodic Labour Force Survey** do not collect specific data on women involved in livestock rearing, making their contributions **invisible** to policymakers and hindering the development of targeted interventions.

2. **Limited Access to Credit and Capital:**
   - Women, especially those in poor households, often lack **collateral** to secure loans for purchasing livestock. This financial exclusion limits their ability to expand or improve their livestock operations.

3. **Limited Access to Extension Services:**
   - **Extension services**, which provide crucial information and guidance on livestock management, are **scarce** for women. Many women face challenges in accessing these services due to **distance**, **cost**, and **gender norms**, which often prevent them from directly participating in such programs.

4. **Lack of Technical Knowledge:**
   - Women livestock farmers often lack the **technical knowledge** needed for tasks like **breeding**, **veterinary care**, and **artificial insemination**, as these responsibilities are predominantly carried out by men. This creates a gap in their ability to improve their livestock management practices.

5. **Lack of Decision-Making Power:**
   - Despite their significant involvement in livestock rearing, women often lack decision-making power in matters concerning livestock and **dairy boards**. Even in **women-only dairy cooperatives**, men typically hold the power to make decisions. Furthermore, **women from marginalized communities**, such as landless or poor Scheduled Caste households, rarely have a voice in the sector's governance.

---

**Conclusion:**
Women play a critical role in livestock rearing in India, contributing significantly to the livelihood of rural households. However, they face several challenges, including the lack of gender-disaggregated data, limited access to credit, insufficient extension services, and technical knowledge gaps. To address these issues, it is essential to ensure **gender equality** in decision-making processes, provide better access to **resources**, and improve the availability of **extension services** for women in the livestock sector. Recognizing women’s contributions and addressing their challenges will not only empower them but also enhance the productivity and sustainability of India’s livestock sector.

**Re-Energising the Livestock Sector: A Key to Sustainable Livelihood and Increased Income for Indian Farmers**

**Introduction:**
The **livestock sector** plays a crucial role in India's economy, contributing **4.11%** to the country's GDP and about **25.6%** to the agricultural GDP. According to the 20th **Livestock Census (2019)**, the livestock population has increased by **4.6%** compared to the 2012 census. Despite this growth, the sector faces several challenges that hinder its potential to become a sustainable source of livelihood and income for farmers in India. 

---

**Challenges Faced by the Livestock Sector:**

1. **Outbreak of Diseases:**
   - The livestock sector is frequently affected by **disease outbreaks** such as **foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)**, **lumpy skin disease (LSD)**, **African swine fever**, and **black quarter infections**. These diseases significantly affect the health of livestock and lead to a decline in productivity, which directly impacts farmers' income.

2. **Feed and Fodder Deficit:**
   - Rapid **urbanization** has led to shrinking land sizes and reduced green cover, resulting in a severe **shortage of feed and fodder**. This shortage is particularly critical in regions where access to quality fodder is limited, affecting the overall health and productivity of livestock.

3. **Limitations in Cross-Breeding:**
   - **Artificial insemination services** in India face several limitations, such as a **lack of quality germplasm**, inadequate **infrastructure**, and **insufficient technical manpower**. As a result, the crossbred population remains low—only **16.6%** in cattle, **21.5%** in pigs, and **5.2%** in sheep, limiting the potential for improved livestock productivity.

4. **Inadequate Extension Services:**
   - **Extension services**—including veterinary care, vaccinations, disease prevention, and awareness programs—remain inadequate. This results in **low productivity** and poor health management, reducing the overall potential of the livestock sector.

5. **Thermal Stress:**
   - Rising temperatures and **heat waves** adversely affect livestock, leading to issues such as **embryonic mortality**, changes in **reproductive cycles**, **low fertility rates**, and **reduced disease resistance**. This thermal stress significantly impacts the fertility and health of animals, further decreasing productivity.

**Measures to Re-Energise the Livestock Sector:**

To overcome these challenges and enhance the potential of the livestock sector, several measures should be implemented:

1. **Strengthening Market Linkages:**
   - Developing **strong linkages between production and markets** is crucial. Establishing **co-operatives**, **producers' associations**, and promoting **contract farming** can ensure that farmers receive fair prices for their livestock products and improve market access.

2. **Mandatory Vaccination and Veterinary Surveillance:**
   - **Primary vaccination** for livestock should be made **mandatory**, with **regular veterinary surveillance** conducted in a time-bound manner to prevent and control diseases, ensuring healthier livestock and higher productivity.

3. **Adoption of High-Yielding Breeds:**
   - The adoption of **high-yielding breeds**, along with access to **easy and timely credit** and **insurance** for farmers, can significantly boost livestock productivity. Supporting the development of **feed and fodder markets** in dryland areas will help address the shortage of feed.

4. **Creation of Indigenous Breed Gene Banks:**
   - Establishing **gene banks** for indigenous breeds can support **research** and help in the **conservation** of breeds that are well adapted to local climates and diseases. These breeds can also serve as a valuable resource for improving overall livestock resilience.

5. **Support for Existing Schemes:**
   - Existing schemes such as the **National Livestock Mission (NLM)**, **Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF)**, **National Programme for Dairy Development Fund (NPDD)**, and **Rashtriya Gokul Mission (RGM)** should receive **increased budgetary allocation** and enhanced support. Clear objectives and proper implementation of these schemes will help improve the sector's overall productivity.

6. **Infrastructure for Export:**
   - Developing **export infrastructure**, including establishing **food safety testing labs** and meeting the requirements of importing countries, will open new markets for Indian livestock products, further boosting the sector's growth.

---

**Conclusion:**
Re-energising the livestock sector is undoubtedly a **key** to ensuring **sustainable livelihoods** and increasing the income of Indian farmers. By addressing the existing challenges through a combination of improved infrastructure, better access to technology, and enhanced support for policies and schemes, the livestock sector can unlock its full potential. Empowering farmers with the right tools and resources will not only increase their income but also make the sector more **resilient** and **sustainable** in the long run.
