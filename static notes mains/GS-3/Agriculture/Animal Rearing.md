**2. Significance of Animal Rearing :** 


Livestock plays a vital role in farmers' economies, especially in India, where mixed farming (combining crops and livestock) enhances resource efficiency. Livestock serves various purposes:

- **Income**  
  - Livestock provides supplementary income for many families, especially those with few animals.  
  - Cows and buffaloes generate regular income through milk sales.  
  - Sheep and goats help during emergencies, such as for weddings, medical expenses, children's education, or house repairs.  
  - Animals also act as assets, offering economic security.

- **Employment**  
  - Agriculture is seasonal, offering work for about 180 days a year. Livestock helps landless or small-scale farmers stay employed during off-seasons.

- **Food**  
  - Livestock products, like milk, meat, and eggs, are key sources of animal protein for livestock owners.

- **Draft**  
  - Bullocks are essential for tasks like ploughing, carting, and transporting goods, especially for small and marginal farmers.

- **Animal Waste**  
  - In rural areas, dung is used for fuel (dung cakes), fertilizer (farmyard manure), and plastering material.

- **Social Functions**  
  - Livestock offers social security, enhancing the status of owners, especially landless families.  
  - Animals are often gifted during weddings and used in various socio-religious rituals, such as worshiping cows and bulls.
