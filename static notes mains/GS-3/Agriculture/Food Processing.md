# Topic : Food processing and related industries in India- scope’ and significance, location, upstream and downstream requirements


**1. Food Processing Industry**  
The food processing industry transforms raw agricultural products into consumable food through physical, chemical, and mechanical processes. It plays a vital role in improving food safety, quality, and shelf life, catering to the needs of a growing global population.

**2. Why Food Processing Industry?**  
The Food Processing Industry (FPI) connects agriculture and industry, impacting both people and the environment. Its significance includes:

- **Reducing Food Wastage**: By using surplus or imperfect produce, FPI helps minimize global food waste, estimated at one-third of total food, and reduces post-harvest losses in India, valued at Rs. 90,000 crore.
- **Reducing Malnutrition**: Fortification of processed foods enhances nutrition by adding essential vitamins and minerals.
- **Preservation**: Techniques like canning, freezing, and dehydration extend food shelf life, preventing spoilage.
- **Employment Generation**: FPI offers both direct and indirect job opportunities in a labor- and technology-intensive sector.
- **Increasing Farmer Income**: Growing demand for processed food boosts the need for raw materials, increasing farmers' earnings.
- **Enhanced Food Safety**: Processes like pasteurization and sterilization reduce harmful microorganisms, ensuring food safety.
- **Crop Diversification**: A growing market encourages farmers to diversify crops and practice mixed farming.

**3. Location of Food Processing Industries in India**  
India has about 2.5 million unorganized micro food processing enterprises, contributing 74.3% of employment (with a third being women), 10% of output, and 27% of value addition, while investing only 7% in plant and machinery. Nearly 66% of these units are in rural areas, with 80% being family-run.

The organized sector, with around 40,000 units, holds 93% of the sector’s plant and machinery value, accounting for 26% of employment and contributing 90% of output and 72% of Gross Value Added (GVA).

Food processing factories are mainly concentrated in coastal states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, and West Bengal, due to access to marine resources, while major non-coastal states include UP, Punjab, and Haryana.
