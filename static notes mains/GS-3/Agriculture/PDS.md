 Topic : Public Distribution System- objectives, functioning, limitations, revamping

### Intro : 

The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a food security initiative under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution. It operates through about 5.37 lakh fair price shops (FPSs) that provide basic food and non-food items at low prices to those in need.

The PDS is managed by both the Central and State Governments:
- The Central Government, through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), handles procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains.
- State Governments are responsible for distribution, identifying eligible families, issuing Ration Cards, and overseeing FPS operations.

Currently, the PDS distributes commodities like wheat, rice, sugar, and kerosene. Some states also provide additional items like pulses, edible oils, iodized salt, and spices through PDS outlets.
