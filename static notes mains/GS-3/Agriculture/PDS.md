 Topic : Public Distribution System- objectives, functioning, limitations, revamping

### Intro : 

The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a food security initiative under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution. It operates through about 5.37 lakh fair price shops (FPSs) that provide basic food and non-food items at low prices to those in need.

The PDS is managed by both the Central and State Governments:
- The Central Government, through the Food Corporation of India (FCI), handles procurement, storage, transportation, and bulk allocation of food grains to state government.
- State Governments are responsible for distribution, identifying eligible families, issuing Ration Cards, and overseeing FPS operations.
