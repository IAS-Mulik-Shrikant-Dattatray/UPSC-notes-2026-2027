**1. Storage and Warehousing in Agriculture**

Storage and warehousing play a crucial role in preserving agricultural produce from harvest to consumption, ensuring food security and a consistent food supply year-round.

**Need for Storage and Warehousing:**

1. **Increasing Production but High Losses:**  
   Despite advances in production technologies and high-yielding varieties, improper storage practices lead to significant losses of agricultural products before they reach consumers.

2. **Food Security and Consistent Supply:**  
   Proper storage ensures food security by extending the shelf life of produce, enabling year-round availability and maintaining food quality.

3. **Global Food Waste:**  
   According to the World Bank, improper storage of food grains and perishables results in wastage that could feed one-third of the world’s poor population. Addressing storage issues could help tackle global food insecurity.

**Conclusion:**

Efficient storage and warehousing systems are essential to reduce post-harvest losses, ensure food availability throughout the year, and support food security. Developing such infrastructure is key to improving the agricultural supply chain and reducing waste.

**1.1. Warehousing in Agriculture**

Warehouses are designed to protect the quantity and quality of stored agricultural products.

**Role of Warehousing:**

- **Scientific Storage:** Protects products from losses using proper preservation methods.
- **Financing:** Banks offer credit (75-80% of product value) against warehouse receipts.
- **Price Stabilization:** Helps stabilize commodity prices by preventing immediate post-harvest sales.
- **Market Intelligence:** Provides market information to those storing their produce.

### 1.1.1. Warehousing in India

**Key Institutions:**
- **Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)**
- **State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)**
- **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**

These institutions are responsible for creating and managing storage facilities in India.

#### **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**
The FCI was established under the Food Corporations Act of 1964 to achieve three main objectives:
- **Price Support**: Safeguard the interests of farmers by supporting prices.
- **Food Grain Distribution**: Ensure smooth distribution of food grains for the Public Distribution System (PDS).
- **National Food Security**: Maintain satisfactory levels of operational and buffer stocks of food grains.

Since its establishment, FCI has played a significant role in transforming India from a food-deficit country to one that is self-sufficient in food grains.

#### **Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution Report (2021)**

The Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution submitted a report in 2021 on FCI’s operations. Some of the key observations and recommendations include:

1. **Procurement**:
   - **State Agencies** handle most procurement operations, with FCI's share being less than 5%. 
   - The committee recommended that the central government and FCI assist state governments in building adequate infrastructure for more efficient procurement.

2. **Decentralized Procurement**:
   - The **decentralized procurement scheme** allows states to use locally procured food grains for distribution under various schemes. This:
     - Reduces transportation costs,
     - Encourages procurement in non-traditional states,
     - Helps procure local grains suited to regional preferences.
   - However, the scheme is underutilized: only 8 states for wheat and 15 for rice have implemented it. The committee suggested encouraging more states to adopt it.

3. **Refusing Procurement at Centers**:
   - Procurement centers sometimes refuse to buy crops on non-substantial technical grounds (e.g., moisture content), leading to distress sales. The committee recommended that food grains meeting Fair Average Quality norms should not be rejected arbitrarily.

4. **Storage Capacity**:
   - **Mismatch between production and storage**: India’s food grain production is 311 MMT, but the storage capacity is only 145 MMT, creating a gap of 166 MMT.
   - The committee highlighted that, despite audits to optimize storage, FCI-owned storage facilities remain underutilized while hired storage facilities are used excessively. The committee recommended maximizing the use of FCI-owned facilities and only hiring when necessary.
   - To address this, the government has approved the creation of the world’s largest grain storage plan in the cooperative sector, involving over 1 lakh Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

5. **Storage and Management Issues**:
   - FCI faces challenges in **unscientific storage** practices. Long-term storage without proper management makes grains vulnerable to damage from pests, moisture, and rodents.
   - **Manual handling** is still common in about 80% of warehouses, which slows down the process and increases inefficiency.

6. **Open-Ended Procurement**:
   - FCI's policy of **open-ended procurement** leads to unsustainable stock accumulation. It strains storage facilities and distorts the food grains market, resulting in mounting debts. As of April 2023, FCI’s total external debt stood at Rs 44,203 crore.

7. **Excess Stock**:
   - FCI often carries **excess stock** beyond the buffer stock norms due to factors like export bans, open-ended procurement, and a lack of a proactive liquidation policy. This results in increased storage costs, and FCI sometimes sells excess grains at a loss, causing significant financial losses.

**1.2.Cold Storage in India: Summary**

**Importance**:  
Cold chain infrastructure is vital for preserving perishable products like fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meat. It ensures temperature-controlled storage, transportation, and distribution to extend shelf life and reduce spoilage, helping reduce food waste and support exports. Proper cold storage also supports achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by reducing loss and improving farmers' income.

**Market Growth**:  
The Indian cold chain market was valued at INR 1.8 lakh Cr in 2022 and is expected to reach INR 3.8 lakh Cr by 2028, with a CAGR of 12.3%.

**Need for Cold Storage**:  
- Extends the shelf life of perishable goods, preventing spoilage.
- Reduces waste and helps in surplus production for exports.
- Supports farmers’ income and contributes to food security.

**Challenges in Cold Chain Infrastructure**:
1. **Under-utilisation**: India has 8,653 cold stores with a capacity of 394.17 lakh MT, but only 60% is used.
2. **Geographical and Logistical Issues**: High summer temperatures (up to 50°C) cause damage to products due to insufficient cold chain systems.
3. **Lack of Awareness**: Farmers, food processors, and logistics experts are unaware of cold storage's benefits.
4. **High Costs**: Building and running cold storage is expensive, with fuel costs making up 45% of operating expenses, much higher than in the West.
5. **Weak Support Ecosystem**: Issues include inadequate equipment, power shortages, poor packaging, vehicle breakdowns, and a lack of skilled labor.
6. **Fragmented Setup**: Cold storage is unevenly distributed, with only a few states (UP, Gujarat, West Bengal, Punjab) holding 60% of the capacity.
7. **Tech Lag**: India lags in adopting technologies like AI, ML, and IoT, leading to inefficient cold chains and losses.

In summary, while cold storage is crucial for the agriculture sector, challenges like underutilization, high costs, logistical issues, and lack of technology hinder the efficiency of the cold chain in India.
