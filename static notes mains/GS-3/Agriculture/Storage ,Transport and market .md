### 1.1.1. Warehousing in India

**Key Institutions:**
- **Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)**
- **State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)**
- **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**

These institutions are responsible for creating and managing storage facilities in India.

#### **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**
The FCI was established under the Food Corporations Act of 1964 to achieve three main objectives:
- **Price Support**: Safeguard the interests of farmers by supporting prices.
- **Food Grain Distribution**: Ensure smooth distribution of food grains for the Public Distribution System (PDS).
- **National Food Security**: Maintain satisfactory levels of operational and buffer stocks of food grains.

Since its establishment, FCI has played a significant role in transforming India from a food-deficit country to one that is self-sufficient in food grains.

#### **Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution Report (2021)**

The Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution submitted a report in 2021 on FCI’s operations. Some of the key observations and recommendations include:

1. **Procurement**:
   - **State Agencies** handle most procurement operations, with FCI's share being less than 5%. 
   - The committee recommended that the central government and FCI assist state governments in building adequate infrastructure for more efficient procurement.

2. **Decentralized Procurement**:
   - The **decentralized procurement scheme** allows states to use locally procured food grains for distribution under various schemes. This:
     - Reduces transportation costs,
     - Encourages procurement in non-traditional states,
     - Helps procure local grains suited to regional preferences.
   - However, the scheme is underutilized: only 8 states for wheat and 15 for rice have implemented it. The committee suggested encouraging more states to adopt it.

3. **Refusing Procurement at Centers**:
   - Procurement centers sometimes refuse to buy crops on non-substantial technical grounds (e.g., moisture content), leading to distress sales. The committee recommended that food grains meeting Fair Average Quality norms should not be rejected arbitrarily.

4. **Storage Capacity**:
   - **Mismatch between production and storage**: India’s food grain production is 311 MMT, but the storage capacity is only 145 MMT, creating a gap of 166 MMT.
   - The committee highlighted that, despite audits to optimize storage, FCI-owned storage facilities remain underutilized while hired storage facilities are used excessively. The committee recommended maximizing the use of FCI-owned facilities and only hiring when necessary.
   - To address this, the government has approved the creation of the world’s largest grain storage plan in the cooperative sector, involving over 1 lakh Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

5. **Storage and Management Issues**:
   - FCI faces challenges in **unscientific storage** practices. Long-term storage without proper management makes grains vulnerable to damage from pests, moisture, and rodents.
   - **Manual handling** is still common in about 80% of warehouses, which slows down the process and increases inefficiency.

6. **Open-Ended Procurement**:
   - FCI's policy of **open-ended procurement** leads to unsustainable stock accumulation. It strains storage facilities and distorts the food grains market, resulting in mounting debts. As of April 2023, FCI’s total external debt stood at Rs 44,203 crore.

7. **Excess Stock**:
   - FCI often carries **excess stock** beyond the buffer stock norms due to factors like export bans, open-ended procurement, and a lack of a proactive liquidation policy. This results in increased storage costs, and FCI sometimes sells excess grains at a loss, causing significant financial losses.
