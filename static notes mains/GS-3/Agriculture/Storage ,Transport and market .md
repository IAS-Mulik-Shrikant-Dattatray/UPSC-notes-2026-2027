**1. Storage and Warehousing in Agriculture**

Storage and warehousing play a crucial role in preserving agricultural produce from harvest to consumption, ensuring food security and a consistent food supply year-round.

**Need for Storage and Warehousing:**

1. **Increasing Production but High Losses:**  
   Despite advances in production technologies and high-yielding varieties, improper storage practices lead to significant losses of agricultural products before they reach consumers.

2. **Food Security and Consistent Supply:**  
   Proper storage ensures food security by extending the shelf life of produce, enabling year-round availability and maintaining food quality.

3. **Global Food Waste:**  
   According to the World Bank, improper storage of food grains and perishables results in wastage that could feed one-third of the worldâ€™s poor population. Addressing storage issues could help tackle global food insecurity.

**Conclusion:**

Efficient storage and warehousing systems are essential to reduce post-harvest losses, ensure food availability throughout the year, and support food security. Developing such infrastructure is key to improving the agricultural supply chain and reducing waste.
