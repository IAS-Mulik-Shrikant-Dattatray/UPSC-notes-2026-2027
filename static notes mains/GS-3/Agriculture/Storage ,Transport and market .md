**1.1. Warehousing in Agriculture**

Warehouses are designed to protect the quantity and quality of stored agricultural products.

**Role of Warehousing:**

- **Scientific Storage:** Protects products from losses using proper preservation methods.
- **Financing:** Banks offer credit (75-80% of product value) against warehouse receipts.
- **Price Stabilization:** Helps stabilize commodity prices by preventing immediate post-harvest sales.
- **Market Intelligence:** Provides market information to those storing their produce.

------



### 1.1.1. Warehousing in India

**Key Institutions:**
- **Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)**
- **State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)**
- **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**

These institutions are responsible for creating and managing storage facilities in India.

#### **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**
The FCI was established under the Food Corporations Act of 1964 to achieve three main objectives:
- **Price Support**: Safeguard the interests of farmers by supporting prices.
- **Food Grain Distribution**: Ensure smooth distribution of food grains for the Public Distribution System (PDS).
- **National Food Security**: Maintain satisfactory levels of operational and buffer stocks of food grains.

Since its establishment, FCI has played a significant role in transforming India from a food-deficit country to one that is self-sufficient in food grains.

#### **Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution Report (2021)**

The Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution submitted a report in 2021 on FCI’s operations. Some of the key observations and recommendations include:

1. **Procurement**:
   - **State Agencies** handle most procurement operations, with FCI's share being less than 5%. 
   - The committee recommended that the central government and FCI assist state governments in building adequate infrastructure for more efficient procurement.

2. **Decentralized Procurement**:
   - The **decentralized procurement scheme** allows states to use locally procured food grains for distribution under various schemes. This:
     - Reduces transportation costs,
     - Encourages procurement in non-traditional states,
     - Helps procure local grains suited to regional preferences.
   - However, the scheme is underutilized: only 8 states for wheat and 15 for rice have implemented it. The committee suggested encouraging more states to adopt it.

3. **Refusing Procurement at Centers**:
   - Procurement centers sometimes refuse to buy crops on non-substantial technical grounds (e.g., moisture content), leading to distress sales. The committee recommended that food grains meeting Fair Average Quality norms should not be rejected arbitrarily.

4. **Storage Capacity**:
   - **Mismatch between production and storage**: India’s food grain production is 311 MMT, but the storage capacity is only 145 MMT, creating a gap of 166 MMT.
   - The committee highlighted that, despite audits to optimize storage, FCI-owned storage facilities remain underutilized while hired storage facilities are used excessively. The committee recommended maximizing the use of FCI-owned facilities and only hiring when necessary.
   - To address this, the government has approved the creation of the world’s largest grain storage plan in the cooperative sector, involving over 1 lakh Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

5. **Storage and Management Issues**:
   - FCI faces challenges in **unscientific storage** practices. Long-term storage without proper management makes grains vulnerable to damage from pests, moisture, and rodents.
   - **Manual handling** is still common in about 80% of warehouses, which slows down the process and increases inefficiency.

6. **Open-Ended Procurement**:
   - FCI's policy of **open-ended procurement** leads to unsustainable stock accumulation. It strains storage facilities and distorts the food grains market, resulting in mounting debts. As of April 2023, FCI’s total external debt stood at Rs 44,203 crore.

7. **Excess Stock**:
   - FCI often carries **excess stock** beyond the buffer stock norms due to factors like export bans, open-ended procurement, and a lack of a proactive liquidation policy. This results in increased storage costs, and FCI sometimes sells excess grains at a loss, causing significant financial losses.

### 3. Marketing :


**3.1. Agricultural Marketing Overview**

Agricultural marketing involves the buying, selling, and movement of farm products from farms to consumers. It includes activities, agencies, and policies related to the procurement of farm inputs and the distribution of produce. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research identifies three main functions in agricultural marketing:

- Assembling (concentration)
- Preparation for consumption (processing)
- Distribution

A 2019 report by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) revealed that, out of 93 million agricultural households in India, 63% sold crops. Of these, 76% sold locally, while only 7.2% used Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets. Additionally, only 5.4% sold to private processors, and 0.37% to contract farming companies. This highlights the need for better marketing systems to ensure better prices. The survey also found that 60% of agricultural households were satisfied with their sales, but 36% were dissatisfied due to receiving lower prices.


------


**3.2. Types	of	Agricultural	Marketing	in	India**

**Types of Agricultural Marketing in India**

1. **Traditional Marketing**:  
   In this method, farmers sell their produce directly, often involving multiple intermediaries. Around 50% of agricultural produce in India is sold through these channels.

2. **Cooperative Marketing**:  
   In this method, agricultural products are directly purchased from farmers through networks like NAFED, which eliminates middlemen.

3. **Emerging Models**:
   - **National Agriculture Market (eNAM)**
   - **Farmer Producer Organizations**
   - **Contract Farming**
   - **Commodity and Future Markets**


------


**3.3. Emerging Models of Agricultural Marketing**

1. **National Agriculture Market (eNAM)**:  
   An online platform for trading agricultural commodities, eNAM connects farmers, traders, and buyers, aiding in better price discovery and smooth marketing of produce.

2. **Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO)**:  
   A legal entity formed by farmers, milk producers, and other primary producers. It can be a cooperative or producer company, where profits and benefits are shared among members.

3. **Contract Farming**:  
   An agreement between farmers and buyers that sets conditions for the production and marketing of farm products.

4. **Commodity and Future Markets**:  
   Future trading helps protect market participants from risks caused by price fluctuations.

------


**3.4. Significance of Agricultural Marketing**

1. **Monetizing the Produce**:  
   Marketing improves the sale of agricultural products, with their value influenced by supply and demand. A developed marketing system enhances competitive trade and better price realization for farmers.

2. **Market Information and Price Signals**:  
   Marketing provides crucial information about demand, quality standards, and specifications, helping producers manage marketable surplus. It also highlights supply chain inefficiencies like post-harvest losses.

3. **Reducing Intermediaries**:  
   Efficient marketing reduces the number of intermediaries in the trade process, replacing them with institutional mechanisms or market structures, improving both economic and product quality outcomes.

4. **Capital Formation and Technology Investment**:  
   Effective agricultural marketing highlights the sector's growth potential, attracting investments and fostering technological advancements.

5. **Value Addition in Agriculture**:  
   Strong marketing systems enable access to downstream industries, driving value addition. For instance, the Makhana snack industry in Bihar grew due to targeted marketing initiatives.

Overall, well-functioning agricultural markets promote growth, food security, employment, and economic prosperity in rural areas.


------


**3.5. Issues in Agricultural Markets in India**

1. **Institutional Issues**:
   - **Licensing Barriers**: The requirement for commission agents/traders to own a shop or godown limits entry, creating monopolies and hindering competition in APMCs.
   - **High Market Charges**: APMCs impose market fees ranging from 0.5% to 2% of produce sales, with additional charges such as purchase tax and weighment fees. In some states, total charges can reach up to 15%.
   - **Lack of Standardized Grading**: The absence of a standardized grading system prevents farmers from receiving fair prices based on produce quality.

2. **Infrastructural Issues**:
   - **Poor Infrastructure**: Only two-thirds of regulated markets have auction platforms, one-fourth have drying yards, and less than 10% have cold storage units or grading facilities.
   - **Economic Viability of Projects**: The long gestation period and seasonality of agricultural surpluses make infrastructure projects economically unviable, deterring investment.

3. **Market Information System Issues**:
   - **Lag in Demand Signals**: The lack of real-time information causes delays in market signals, with farmers relying on past price trends, which may not be accurate for future seasons.
   - **Limited Information Channels**: Current systems (e.g., newspapers, APMC boards) mainly provide price information, are often distant from farmers, and are not in local languages.
   - **Low Awareness of Information Channels**: Few farmers use accessible systems like SMS-based advisories or voice interaction systems.

4. **Other Issues**:
   - **Absence of National Integrated Market**: There is no nationwide regulation for APMCs, and existing regulations fail to create a barrier-free market.
   - **Limited Public Investment**: Public spending on agricultural marketing is low, with less than 1% dedicated to infrastructure development.

These issues result in low price realization for farmers, food insecurity, and high supply chain wastages.

----


**3.6. Regulation of Agricultural Marketing**

Agriculture is a state subject under the Indian Constitution, and agricultural marketing is primarily regulated by APMCs (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) established by state governments through respective APMC Acts. APMCs, also known as mandis, are physical market infrastructures found in most states (except Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Kerala, and Manipur). These mandis regulate key market practices such as weighing, sales methods, grading, and payment procedures. Currently, India has 7,246 functioning mandis.

-----


**3.6.1. Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC)**

The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) is a statutory body formed by state governments to regulate trade in certain agricultural, horticultural, or livestock products, under the APMC Act of the respective state.


![alt text](image-35.png)


-----

**3.6.2. Major Issues in the Functioning of APMCs**:
- **Monopsony**: The APMC regulations prevent exporters and processors from buying directly from farmers, creating a market with only one buyer, leading to manipulated pricing and discouraging processing and exports.
- **Price Manipulation**: This monopsony results in farmers selling produce at lower prices, while intermediaries sell at higher prices, defeating the purpose of APMCs.
- **Over-Regulation**: Excessive regulation leads to corruption and farmer exploitation.
- **Market Fragmentation**: Issues like multiple license fees, limited licenses, late payments, and lack of facilities (e.g., grading, storage) hinder farmers rather than help them.
- **Restricted Private Sector Involvement**: Only state governments can set up markets, limiting private sector investment in marketing infrastructure.
- **Conflicted Role**: APMCs often act as both regulators and market operators, which undermines their regulatory role due to vested interests in trade. Members and chairmen are often elected from among market agents, leading to conflicts of interest.


-----


**3.6.3. Model APMC Act, 2003**

To address inefficiencies in APMC functioning, the Ministry of Agriculture introduced the **Model Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2003**. This act aimed to deregulate the agricultural marketing system, promote investment in infrastructure, encourage direct marketing by the corporate sector, and create a national market.

The **Model APMC Act, 2003**:
- Provides farmers the freedom to sell produce directly to contract sponsors or in markets set up by private individuals, consumers, or producers.
- Enhances market competitiveness by allowing common registration of market intermediaries.

**Criticisms of the Model APMC Act**:
- It does not fully establish a national or state-level common market for agricultural commodities.
- It still requires buyers to pay APMC charges, even if the produce is sold outside APMC areas.
- While it allows private sector markets, it fails to foster competition, as private market owners must collect APMC fees along with their own charges.


-----


**3.6.4. Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017**

The Government of India introduced the **Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017** to replace the **Agriculture Produce Markets Committee Act, 2003**.

**Objectives**:
- Create a unified agri-market for trading both agricultural produce and livestock with a single license.
- Ensure better price realization for farmers.
- Aim to double farmers' income by 2022.

**Major Provisions**:
- A single fee for intra-state trade.
- Traders can sell perishable goods like fruits and vegetables outside existing mandis.
- The law proposes a cap on market fees and commission charges:
  - 2% for fruits and vegetables
  - 1% for food grains
- Warehouses and cold storage facilities will be regulated as markets.
- Regulatory powers will be transferred to the Director of Agricultural Marketing in the state, who will issue licenses to traders and private players.
- Farmers can directly sell their produce to bulk buyers.

-----

**3.6.5. Model Contract Farming Act, 2017**

**Contract farming** involves a pre-harvest agreement between buyers (e.g., food processors, exporters) and producers (farmers or farmer organizations) for agricultural production, including livestock and poultry.


![alt text](image-37.png)


**Benefits**:
- Producers reduce the risk of fluctuating market prices and demand.
- Buyers secure a steady supply of quality produce.

**Issues**:
- Existing laws only apply to a few farm commodities and focus primarily on marketing.

**Challenges with Contract Farming**:
- **State Reluctance**: States hesitate to implement reforms due to concerns over loss of revenue.
- **Stockholding Limits**: Restrictions under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 discourage buyers from entering contracts.
- **Lack of Uniformity**: Inconsistent laws across states regarding the types of produce and conditions hinder contract farming.
- **Regional Inequality**: Contract farming is mostly practiced in agriculturally developed states (e.g., Punjab, Tamil Nadu), while small and marginal farmers in other states miss out.
- **Supply-Side Issues**: Small and marginal farmers (with an average landholding of 1.15 hectares) face high transaction costs, deterring buyers from engaging with them.
- **Capital-Intensive and Unsustainable**: It promotes the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides, negatively impacting the environment and human health.
- **Monoculture Farming**: Encourages monoculture, harming soil health and increasing food security risks.
- **Increased Dependency**: Farmers become dependent on corporations for inputs, making them vulnerable.
- **Predetermined Prices**: Fixed prices may prevent farmers from benefiting from higher market prices.

**1. How Far Can Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Help in Improving the Storage, Transportation, and Marketing of Agricultural Produce in India?**

**Introduction to PPPs in Agriculture:**
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors aimed at leveraging private investment, technology, and expertise to improve public services and infrastructure. In India, these partnerships are crucial in the agricultural sector, especially in enhancing the storage, transportation, and marketing of agricultural produce.

**Significance of PPP in Improving Agricultural Infrastructure:**
1. **Modern Technology:**
   - PPPs can introduce advanced technologies for handling perishable agricultural produce, reducing waste and improving storage systems. Innovations like cold storage, mechanized handling, and efficient transportation systems can significantly reduce post-harvest losses.

2. **Investments:**
   - PPPs bring private capital into agriculture, supplementing public investment. This helps in building infrastructure such as cold storage facilities, warehouses, and quality certification systems. For instance, private investments can help develop large-scale storage systems, which farmers often lack access to.

3. **Optimizing Risk Allocation:**
   - The high post-harvest losses (ranging from 10% to 25%) can be reduced through the "hub and spoke" model in PPPs. This model connects farm collection points to primary processing centers, optimizing the supply chain and minimizing losses in transportation and storage.

4. **Infrastructure Development:**

**4. Discuss the Impact of Inadequate Marketing Infrastructure on Small and Marginal Farmers. How Can Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) Assist in Improving Marketing Efficiency for the Benefit of Such Farmers?**

**Introduction:**
India’s agricultural marketing infrastructure is highly fragmented and underdeveloped. This inadequacy results in inefficient marketing channels, high transaction costs, and low procurement by state agencies. As a result, small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85% of the total farming population, face significant challenges in effectively marketing their produce. The lack of access to proper infrastructure and fair pricing severely affects their income and overall livelihood.

**Impact of Inadequate Marketing Infrastructure on Small and Marginal Farmers:**

1. **Limited Market Access:**
   - A major consequence of inadequate marketing infrastructure is limited access to distant markets. Small farmers often depend on local and unorganized markets that offer lower prices. According to the National Institute of Agricultural Marketing (NIAM), many farmers cannot access better markets due to geographical and logistical barriers. As a result, they are forced to sell their produce at lower prices in local markets, depriving them of the opportunity to earn fair returns.

2. **Post-Harvest Losses:**
   - India faces significant post-harvest losses, particularly in horticultural products. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) reports that about 30% of India’s horticultural produce is lost annually due to inadequate storage, transportation, and processing infrastructure. This directly affects small farmers, who cannot afford advanced storage and preservation technologies, leading to wastage of a significant portion of their produce.

3. **Information Asymmetry:**
   - Small farmers often lack access to real-time market information, including price trends and demand forecasts. This information gap hinders their ability to make informed decisions regarding when and where to sell their produce. As a result, they may sell at unfavorable times or to intermediaries who offer lower prices, reducing their profits.

4. **Exploitation by Middlemen:**
   - The absence of direct market access forces farmers to sell their produce through middlemen, who often charge high commissions and exploit farmers. These middlemen, by controlling access to markets, reduce the bargaining power of farmers, leading to a significant reduction in the amount farmers earn from their produce.

**Role of Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) in Improving Marketing Efficiency:**

1. **Collective Bargaining Power:**
   - FPOs offer small farmers an institutional platform that enables collective bargaining. By pooling their produce, farmers can negotiate better prices and terms with buyers. For instance, the cooperative model of Amul empowers dairy farmers to negotiate higher prices for milk, increasing their incomes. This collective approach allows small farmers to overcome the challenge of their small-scale production and enhances their market competitiveness.

2. **Infrastructure Development:**
   - FPOs can help in the development of essential marketing infrastructure such as sorting, grading, packaging, and storage. For example, LEAF (Lawrencedale Agro Processing India Pvt. Ltd.) has set up infrastructure for small farmers to process their produce, which not only adds value to their products but also reduces post-harvest losses. The availability of such facilities within FPOs ensures that farmers' produce maintains its quality, thus fetching higher market prices.

3. **Value Addition and Branding:**
   - FPOs also play a key role in value addition and branding, which significantly increases the marketability of agricultural produce. The 'Himalaya' brand, developed by the Sikkim State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation Ltd. (SIMFED), is an example of how farmers, especially those growing organic produce, can sell under a common brand. This branding helps farmers fetch better prices for their organic produce, which is increasingly in demand globally.

4. **Market Linkages:**
   - FPOs facilitate direct market linkages, bypassing intermediaries and ensuring that farmers can sell their products directly to consumers or institutional buyers. The Uralungal Labour Contract Co-operative Society (ULCCS) in Kerala has developed such market linkages, allowing its members to sell directly to buyers, thereby improving farmers' profits. These linkages help small farmers reach larger markets without the burden of middlemen.

**Conclusion:**
While Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) can help improve the marketing efficiency of small and marginal farmers, addressing the inadequacies in India's agricultural marketing infrastructure is crucial. The benefits of FPOs, including collective bargaining, infrastructure development, and direct market linkages, can help enhance farmers’ incomes and reduce exploitation by intermediaries. However, the larger issue of infrastructure gaps, such as inadequate storage facilities, inefficient transportation, and the lack of market access, needs to be addressed to ensure that farmers can achieve remunerative prices for their produce. For India to achieve its goal of doubling farmers' incomes, a comprehensive approach that includes both institutional support through FPOs and infrastructure improvements is necessary.

**5. Discuss the Factors Hindering the Uptake of Integrated Cold Chain Infrastructure in India.**

**Introduction:**
Integrated cold chain infrastructure (CCI) is crucial for the agricultural sector, especially in handling perishable goods like fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meat. It ensures that these products maintain their quality, safety, and shelf life, which is essential for both domestic consumption and export. An efficient CCI can reduce post-harvest losses, create employment opportunities, boost food processing, and enhance the competitiveness of Indian agricultural products in global markets. However, despite its importance, less than 10% of India’s agricultural produce currently passes through an integrated cold chain.

**Factors Hindering the Uptake of Integrated Cold Chain Infrastructure:**

1. **Investment Barriers:**
   - **High Initial Capital and Long Payback Periods:** Establishing integrated cold chain infrastructure requires significant upfront investment in facilities like cold storage, refrigerated transport, and pack houses. However, the payback periods for such investments can be long, deterring potential investors. Additionally, the risk of technology becoming outdated before the investment is recouped further discourages capital infusion into the sector.
   
2. **Lack of Awareness:**
   - Many stakeholders, particularly small farmers, lack awareness about the benefits of cold chain infrastructure. Often, cold chain facilities are perceived as a luxury rather than a necessity for maintaining the quality, safety, and longevity of perishable goods. This perception hinders their adoption, especially in rural areas where the need for such infrastructure is high.

3. **Limited Technological Integration:**
   - Many cold chain facilities still rely on manual processes for temperature monitoring, inventory management, and data recording. The lack of technological integration results in inefficiencies such as data inaccuracies, delays in decision-making, and an increased risk of spoilage. The absence of advanced technologies like IoT-based temperature tracking and automated systems adds to the operational costs and risks.

4. **High Operating Costs:**
   - Operating an integrated cold chain system incurs significant ongoing expenses, particularly due to the high fuel costs involved in refrigerated transport and maintaining constant temperatures in storage units. In India, fuel costs account for around 45% of the operating expenses for cold storage, making it economically unfeasible for many operators and increasing the cost of accessing cold chain facilities for farmers.

5. **Lack of a Holistic Approach:**
   - The Indian government's approach to cold chain infrastructure development has been piecemeal. A disproportionate amount of subsidies has been directed towards cold storage facilities, while other critical components such as refrigerated transport, pack houses, and pre-cooling units receive far less support. This lack of a comprehensive approach leads to gaps in the cold chain system, limiting its overall effectiveness.

6. **Inefficient Infrastructure:**
   - India’s cold chain infrastructure suffers from various inefficiencies, such as inconsistent power supply, poor last-mile connectivity, and inadequate refrigerated transportation networks. These inefficiencies undermine the effectiveness of cold chain systems, leading to losses and increased operational costs. The absence of a seamless, integrated system reduces the reliability of cold chain infrastructure, making it less attractive for investment.

7. **Accessibility Issues:**
   - Most cold chain infrastructure is concentrated in urban areas, leaving rural regions underserved. This uneven distribution of infrastructure leads to low demand aggregation in rural areas, resulting in underutilized facilities and making cold chain services more expensive for farmers in remote regions. Farmers in these areas often cannot afford to transport their produce to distant cold storage facilities, leading to post-harvest losses and lower-quality products.

**Conclusion:**
The lack of adequate and efficient integrated cold chain infrastructure in India contributes to massive post-harvest losses, estimated at ₹92,561 crores annually. To overcome these challenges, a system-wide approach is needed. This includes educating farmers about the importance of cold chain infrastructure, adopting innovative business models like "pay-as-you-store" to make cold chain services more affordable, and integrating technology to improve operational efficiency. By addressing investment barriers, improving infrastructure, and ensuring a more even distribution of cold chain facilities, India can harness the full potential of its agricultural sector and reduce post-harvest losses, benefiting both farmers and consumers.
