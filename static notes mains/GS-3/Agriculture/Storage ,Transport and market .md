**1.1. Warehousing in Agriculture**

Warehouses are designed to protect the quantity and quality of stored agricultural products.

**Role of Warehousing:**

- **Scientific Storage:** Protects products from losses using proper preservation methods.
- **Financing:** Banks offer credit (75-80% of product value) against warehouse receipts.
- **Price Stabilization:** Helps stabilize commodity prices by preventing immediate post-harvest sales.
- **Market Intelligence:** Provides market information to those storing their produce.

------



### 1.1.1. Warehousing in India

**Key Institutions:**
- **Central Warehousing Corporation (CWC)**
- **State Warehousing Corporations (SWCs)**
- **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**

These institutions are responsible for creating and managing storage facilities in India.

#### **Food Corporation of India (FCI)**
The FCI was established under the Food Corporations Act of 1964 to achieve three main objectives:
- **Price Support**: Safeguard the interests of farmers by supporting prices.
- **Food Grain Distribution**: Ensure smooth distribution of food grains for the Public Distribution System (PDS).
- **National Food Security**: Maintain satisfactory levels of operational and buffer stocks of food grains.

Since its establishment, FCI has played a significant role in transforming India from a food-deficit country to one that is self-sufficient in food grains.

#### **Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution Report (2021)**

The Standing Committee on Food, Consumer Affairs, and Public Distribution submitted a report in 2021 on FCI’s operations. Some of the key observations and recommendations include:

1. **Procurement**:
   - **State Agencies** handle most procurement operations, with FCI's share being less than 5%. 
   - The committee recommended that the central government and FCI assist state governments in building adequate infrastructure for more efficient procurement.

2. **Decentralized Procurement**:
   - The **decentralized procurement scheme** allows states to use locally procured food grains for distribution under various schemes. This:
     - Reduces transportation costs,
     - Encourages procurement in non-traditional states,
     - Helps procure local grains suited to regional preferences.
   - However, the scheme is underutilized: only 8 states for wheat and 15 for rice have implemented it. The committee suggested encouraging more states to adopt it.

3. **Refusing Procurement at Centers**:
   - Procurement centers sometimes refuse to buy crops on non-substantial technical grounds (e.g., moisture content), leading to distress sales. The committee recommended that food grains meeting Fair Average Quality norms should not be rejected arbitrarily.

4. **Storage Capacity**:
   - **Mismatch between production and storage**: India’s food grain production is 311 MMT, but the storage capacity is only 145 MMT, creating a gap of 166 MMT.
   - The committee highlighted that, despite audits to optimize storage, FCI-owned storage facilities remain underutilized while hired storage facilities are used excessively. The committee recommended maximizing the use of FCI-owned facilities and only hiring when necessary.
   - To address this, the government has approved the creation of the world’s largest grain storage plan in the cooperative sector, involving over 1 lakh Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).

5. **Storage and Management Issues**:
   - FCI faces challenges in **unscientific storage** practices. Long-term storage without proper management makes grains vulnerable to damage from pests, moisture, and rodents.
   - **Manual handling** is still common in about 80% of warehouses, which slows down the process and increases inefficiency.

6. **Open-Ended Procurement**:
   - FCI's policy of **open-ended procurement** leads to unsustainable stock accumulation. It strains storage facilities and distorts the food grains market, resulting in mounting debts. As of April 2023, FCI’s total external debt stood at Rs 44,203 crore.

7. **Excess Stock**:
   - FCI often carries **excess stock** beyond the buffer stock norms due to factors like export bans, open-ended procurement, and a lack of a proactive liquidation policy. This results in increased storage costs, and FCI sometimes sells excess grains at a loss, causing significant financial losses.

### 3. Marketing :


**3.1. Agricultural Marketing Overview**

Agricultural marketing involves the buying, selling, and movement of farm products from farms to consumers. It includes activities, agencies, and policies related to the procurement of farm inputs and the distribution of produce. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research identifies three main functions in agricultural marketing:

- Assembling (concentration)
- Preparation for consumption (processing)
- Distribution

A 2019 report by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) revealed that, out of 93 million agricultural households in India, 63% sold crops. Of these, 76% sold locally, while only 7.2% used Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) markets. Additionally, only 5.4% sold to private processors, and 0.37% to contract farming companies. This highlights the need for better marketing systems to ensure better prices. The survey also found that 60% of agricultural households were satisfied with their sales, but 36% were dissatisfied due to receiving lower prices.


------


**3.2. Types	of	Agricultural	Marketing	in	India**

**Types of Agricultural Marketing in India**

1. **Traditional Marketing**:  
   In this method, farmers sell their produce directly, often involving multiple intermediaries. Around 50% of agricultural produce in India is sold through these channels.

2. **Cooperative Marketing**:  
   In this method, agricultural products are directly purchased from farmers through networks like NAFED, which eliminates middlemen.

3. **Emerging Models**:
   - **National Agriculture Market (eNAM)**
   - **Farmer Producer Organizations**
   - **Contract Farming**
   - **Commodity and Future Markets**


------


**3.3. Emerging Models of Agricultural Marketing**

1. **National Agriculture Market (eNAM)**:  
   An online platform for trading agricultural commodities, eNAM connects farmers, traders, and buyers, aiding in better price discovery and smooth marketing of produce.

2. **Farmer Producer Organizations (FPO)**:  
   A legal entity formed by farmers, milk producers, and other primary producers. It can be a cooperative or producer company, where profits and benefits are shared among members.

3. **Contract Farming**:  
   An agreement between farmers and buyers that sets conditions for the production and marketing of farm products.

4. **Commodity and Future Markets**:  
   Future trading helps protect market participants from risks caused by price fluctuations.

------


**3.4. Significance of Agricultural Marketing**

1. **Monetizing the Produce**:  
   Marketing improves the sale of agricultural products, with their value influenced by supply and demand. A developed marketing system enhances competitive trade and better price realization for farmers.

2. **Market Information and Price Signals**:  
   Marketing provides crucial information about demand, quality standards, and specifications, helping producers manage marketable surplus. It also highlights supply chain inefficiencies like post-harvest losses.

3. **Reducing Intermediaries**:  
   Efficient marketing reduces the number of intermediaries in the trade process, replacing them with institutional mechanisms or market structures, improving both economic and product quality outcomes.

4. **Capital Formation and Technology Investment**:  
   Effective agricultural marketing highlights the sector's growth potential, attracting investments and fostering technological advancements.

5. **Value Addition in Agriculture**:  
   Strong marketing systems enable access to downstream industries, driving value addition. For instance, the Makhana snack industry in Bihar grew due to targeted marketing initiatives.

Overall, well-functioning agricultural markets promote growth, food security, employment, and economic prosperity in rural areas.


------


**3.5. Issues in Agricultural Markets in India**

1. **Institutional Issues**:
   - **Licensing Barriers**: The requirement for commission agents/traders to own a shop or godown limits entry, creating monopolies and hindering competition in APMCs.
   - **High Market Charges**: APMCs impose market fees ranging from 0.5% to 2% of produce sales, with additional charges such as purchase tax and weighment fees. In some states, total charges can reach up to 15%.
   - **Lack of Standardized Grading**: The absence of a standardized grading system prevents farmers from receiving fair prices based on produce quality.

2. **Infrastructural Issues**:
   - **Poor Infrastructure**: Only two-thirds of regulated markets have auction platforms, one-fourth have drying yards, and less than 10% have cold storage units or grading facilities.
   - **Economic Viability of Projects**: The long gestation period and seasonality of agricultural surpluses make infrastructure projects economically unviable, deterring investment.

3. **Market Information System Issues**:
   - **Lag in Demand Signals**: The lack of real-time information causes delays in market signals, with farmers relying on past price trends, which may not be accurate for future seasons.
   - **Limited Information Channels**: Current systems (e.g., newspapers, APMC boards) mainly provide price information, are often distant from farmers, and are not in local languages.
   - **Low Awareness of Information Channels**: Few farmers use accessible systems like SMS-based advisories or voice interaction systems.

4. **Other Issues**:
   - **Absence of National Integrated Market**: There is no nationwide regulation for APMCs, and existing regulations fail to create a barrier-free market.
   - **Limited Public Investment**: Public spending on agricultural marketing is low, with less than 1% dedicated to infrastructure development.

These issues result in low price realization for farmers, food insecurity, and high supply chain wastages.

----


**3.6. Regulation of Agricultural Marketing**

Agriculture is a state subject under the Indian Constitution, and agricultural marketing is primarily regulated by APMCs (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) established by state governments through respective APMC Acts. APMCs, also known as mandis, are physical market infrastructures found in most states (except Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, Kerala, and Manipur). These mandis regulate key market practices such as weighing, sales methods, grading, and payment procedures. Currently, India has 7,246 functioning mandis.

-----


**3.6.1. Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC)**

The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) is a statutory body formed by state governments to regulate trade in certain agricultural, horticultural, or livestock products, under the APMC Act of the respective state.


![alt text](image-35.png)


-----

**3.6.2. Major Issues in the Functioning of APMCs**:
- **Monopsony**: The APMC regulations prevent exporters and processors from buying directly from farmers, creating a market with only one buyer, leading to manipulated pricing and discouraging processing and exports.
- **Price Manipulation**: This monopsony results in farmers selling produce at lower prices, while intermediaries sell at higher prices, defeating the purpose of APMCs.
- **Over-Regulation**: Excessive regulation leads to corruption and farmer exploitation.
- **Market Fragmentation**: Issues like multiple license fees, limited licenses, late payments, and lack of facilities (e.g., grading, storage) hinder farmers rather than help them.
- **Restricted Private Sector Involvement**: Only state governments can set up markets, limiting private sector investment in marketing infrastructure.
- **Conflicted Role**: APMCs often act as both regulators and market operators, which undermines their regulatory role due to vested interests in trade. Members and chairmen are often elected from among market agents, leading to conflicts of interest.


-----


**3.6.3. Model APMC Act, 2003**

To address inefficiencies in APMC functioning, the Ministry of Agriculture introduced the **Model Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act, 2003**. This act aimed to deregulate the agricultural marketing system, promote investment in infrastructure, encourage direct marketing by the corporate sector, and create a national market.

The **Model APMC Act, 2003**:
- Provides farmers the freedom to sell produce directly to contract sponsors or in markets set up by private individuals, consumers, or producers.
- Enhances market competitiveness by allowing common registration of market intermediaries.

**Criticisms of the Model APMC Act**:
- It does not fully establish a national or state-level common market for agricultural commodities.
- It still requires buyers to pay APMC charges, even if the produce is sold outside APMC areas.
- While it allows private sector markets, it fails to foster competition, as private market owners must collect APMC fees along with their own charges.


-----


**3.6.4. Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017**

The Government of India introduced the **Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2017** to replace the **Agriculture Produce Markets Committee Act, 2003**.

**Objectives**:
- Create a unified agri-market for trading both agricultural produce and livestock with a single license.
- Ensure better price realization for farmers.
- Aim to double farmers' income by 2022.

**Major Provisions**:
- A single fee for intra-state trade.
- Traders can sell perishable goods like fruits and vegetables outside existing mandis.
- The law proposes a cap on market fees and commission charges:
  - 2% for fruits and vegetables
  - 1% for food grains
- Warehouses and cold storage facilities will be regulated as markets.
- Regulatory powers will be transferred to the Director of Agricultural Marketing in the state, who will issue licenses to traders and private players.
- Farmers can directly sell their produce to bulk buyers.

-----

**3.6.5. Model Contract Farming Act, 2017**

**Contract farming** involves a pre-harvest agreement between buyers (e.g., food processors, exporters) and producers (farmers or farmer organizations) for agricultural production, including livestock and poultry.


![alt text](image-37.png)


**Benefits**:
- Producers reduce the risk of fluctuating market prices and demand.
- Buyers secure a steady supply of quality produce.

**Issues**:
- Existing laws only apply to a few farm commodities and focus primarily on marketing.

**Challenges with Contract Farming**:
- **State Reluctance**: States hesitate to implement reforms due to concerns over loss of revenue.
- **Stockholding Limits**: Restrictions under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 discourage buyers from entering contracts.
- **Lack of Uniformity**: Inconsistent laws across states regarding the types of produce and conditions hinder contract farming.
- **Regional Inequality**: Contract farming is mostly practiced in agriculturally developed states (e.g., Punjab, Tamil Nadu), while small and marginal farmers in other states miss out.
- **Supply-Side Issues**: Small and marginal farmers (with an average landholding of 1.15 hectares) face high transaction costs, deterring buyers from engaging with them.
- **Capital-Intensive and Unsustainable**: It promotes the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides, negatively impacting the environment and human health.
- **Monoculture Farming**: Encourages monoculture, harming soil health and increasing food security risks.
- **Increased Dependency**: Farmers become dependent on corporations for inputs, making them vulnerable.
- **Predetermined Prices**: Fixed prices may prevent farmers from benefiting from higher market prices.

**1. How Far Can Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) Help in Improving the Storage, Transportation, and Marketing of Agricultural Produce in India?**

**Introduction to PPPs in Agriculture:**
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors aimed at leveraging private investment, technology, and expertise to improve public services and infrastructure. In India, these partnerships are crucial in the agricultural sector, especially in enhancing the storage, transportation, and marketing of agricultural produce.

**Significance of PPP in Improving Agricultural Infrastructure:**
1. **Modern Technology:**
   - PPPs can introduce advanced technologies for handling perishable agricultural produce, reducing waste and improving storage systems. Innovations like cold storage, mechanized handling, and efficient transportation systems can significantly reduce post-harvest losses.

2. **Investments:**
   - PPPs bring private capital into agriculture, supplementing public investment. This helps in building infrastructure such as cold storage facilities, warehouses, and quality certification systems. For instance, private investments can help develop large-scale storage systems, which farmers often lack access to.

3. **Optimizing Risk Allocation:**
   - The high post-harvest losses (ranging from 10% to 25%) can be reduced through the "hub and spoke" model in PPPs. This model connects farm collection points to primary processing centers, optimizing the supply chain and minimizing losses in transportation and storage.

4. **Infrastructure Development:**
   - The private sector can contribute to building essential infrastructure for bulk handling, storage, and transportation of agricultural goods through models like Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT), Build-Own-Lease-Transfer (BOLT), and joint ventures. This helps in scaling up the capacity of storage and logistics across the country.

5. **Better Market Access:**
   - PPPs can help integrate farmers with both domestic and international markets by creating better access to infrastructure, such as processing units and transportation networks. This also helps unlock the potential of agro-climatic regions and their diverse agricultural produce.

6. **Knowledge Management:**
   - The sharing of knowledge between public and private sectors enhances the effectiveness of agricultural marketing systems. Private entities bring expertise in logistics and technology, while the public sector offers regulatory support and policies that improve the overall system.

**Challenges in Implementing PPPs in Agricultural Marketing:**
1. **Role Ambiguity:**
   - If the roles of public and private entities are not clearly defined, it may lead to market distortion. Public funding could end up subsidizing private benefits, which can undermine the efficiency of the model.

2. **Lack of Government Capacity:**
   - Inadequate public institutions or legislative arrangements may hinder the ability of PPPs to function effectively. Without strong government institutions to support the partnership, PPPs may not be able to deliver their intended benefits.

3. **Differences in Work Culture:**
   - Public and private sectors have different goals. The public sector often focuses on broader social outcomes, while the private sector is driven by profit motives. These differences can lead to challenges in collaboration and long-term sustainability of PPP initiatives.

4. **Fragmented Resources:**
   - Public sector resources, such as research and scientific expertise, are often fragmented across various ministries. This lack of coordination can hinder the efficient implementation of agricultural marketing initiatives under PPPs.

**Conclusion:**
While PPPs have the potential to significantly improve the storage, transportation, and marketing of agricultural produce in India, their success depends on clear role definition, transparency, and effective governance. Both public and private partners must be held accountable, with the public sector playing a key role in regulation and ensuring that private sector participation benefits farmers and the broader agricultural ecosystem. By addressing the challenges, PPPs can drive transformative change in the agricultural marketing landscape.
