# Topic :  Issues of buffer stocks



**Introduction :**  


A **buffer stock** system is a mechanism designed to stabilize agricultural prices by balancing the supply of food grains in the market. It involves the government purchasing and storing food during surplus harvests to prevent prices from falling below a target level, and releasing stocks during periods of scarcity to prevent prices from rising above a target range.

**Function of Buffer Stocks**  
- **Stabilizing Prices**: The main aim is to neutralize fluctuations in the production of crops, ensuring that prices remain stable regardless of seasonal variations.
- **Surplus Production**: During periods of abundant harvest, the government procures crops from farmers at a **Minimum Support Price (MSP)** to prevent market prices from plummeting. This ensures that farmers benefit from their surplus production and do not face financial losses.
- **Deficit Production**: During times of crop failure or shortages, the government releases these buffer stocks in a controlled manner. This ensures that consumers have access to food grains at affordable prices and prevents price hikes due to supply shortages. It also helps in maintaining food security and ensuring the availability of essential food grains for the population.  

The buffer stock system plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of both **farmers** (by stabilizing their income) and **consumers** (by ensuring stable prices and availability).

**Buffer Stock Policy of India**

The **buffer stock policy** in India was introduced during the **Fourth Five Year Plan (1969-74)**. Under this policy, a buffer stock of food grains is maintained by the **Food Corporation of India (FCI)** on behalf of the Government of India. The primary objective is to stabilize the prices of essential food grains by ensuring adequate supply during times of scarcity.

**Key Features of the Buffer Stock Policy:**

1. **Buffer Norms**:  
   The **Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA)**, chaired by the Prime Minister, fixes the buffer stock norms on a quarterly basisâ€”on **1st April, 1st July, 1st October, and 1st January** of each financial year. The norms were revised in **January 2015** to enhance the buffer system's effectiveness.

2. **Components of Operational Stock**:  
   The operational stock refers to the food grains earmarked for:
   - **Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS)**
   - **Other Welfare Schemes (OWS)**  
   - **Food Security Stocks/Reserves**

3. **Strategic Reserve**:  
   In addition to buffer norms, a **strategic reserve** is maintained for emergency situations. This reserve includes:
   - **30 lakh tonnes of wheat**  
   - **20 lakh tonnes of rice**

4. **Pulses Buffer Stock**:  
   From **2015**, the government also decided to create a buffer stock for **pulses** to stabilize their prices. The buffer stock for pulses is set at **1.5 lakh tonnes**, with procurement managed by organizations like **NAFED**, **SFAC**, and **FCI**.

5. **Excess Stock Management**:  
   Any food stock above the minimum buffer norms is considered **excess stock**. The government can manage this excess stock by:
   - Exporting it
   - Selling it through **open market sales**  
   - Allocating it **additionally to states**  

The buffer stock system is essential for preventing inflationary pressures on food prices, ensuring food security, and managing the risks associated with fluctuating agricultural production in India.
