# Topic :  Issues of buffer stocks



**Introduction**  
A **buffer stock** system is a mechanism designed to stabilize agricultural prices by balancing the supply of food grains in the market. It involves the government purchasing and storing food during surplus harvests to prevent prices from falling below a target level, and releasing stocks during periods of scarcity to prevent prices from rising above a target range.

**Function of Buffer Stocks**  
- **Stabilizing Prices**: The main aim is to neutralize fluctuations in the production of crops, ensuring that prices remain stable regardless of seasonal variations.
- **Surplus Production**: During periods of abundant harvest, the government procures crops from farmers at a **Minimum Support Price (MSP)** to prevent market prices from plummeting. This ensures that farmers benefit from their surplus production and do not face financial losses.
- **Deficit Production**: During times of crop failure or shortages, the government releases these buffer stocks in a controlled manner. This ensures that consumers have access to food grains at affordable prices and prevents price hikes due to supply shortages. It also helps in maintaining food security and ensuring the availability of essential food grains for the population.  

The buffer stock system plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of both **farmers** (by stabilizing their income) and **consumers** (by ensuring stable prices and availability).
