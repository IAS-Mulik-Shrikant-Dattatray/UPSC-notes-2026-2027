# Topic : E-technology in the aid of farmers.



**1. Introduction**

The agriculture sector is vital to India, providing livelihoods for 58% of the population and contributing 18% to GDP. However, growth in agriculture has been slow, with a 1.4% increase in GVA during FY24.

Key challenges hindering growth include:

- Low productivity
- Fragmented landholding
- Market imbalances due to over/under production
- Lack of modern agricultural practices and farm marketing reforms
- Global competition requiring higher quality products at competitive prices

To overcome these issues, farmers need better training in resource management and production. E-technology can play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and improving farmers' livelihoods.

Note :

**E-Technology and E-Agriculture**

E-technology refers to the use of electronic devices, satellite communication, mobile services, and applications to transmit information through technology.

E-agriculture is the application of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in agriculture, focusing on how ICT can support agricultural development.

**2. Uses of E-Technology for Farmers**

E-technology can benefit the agriculture sector in several ways:

- **Improved Decision-Making**: By providing timely and relevant information on:
  - Agro-inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides)
  - Crop and soil health management
  - Weather forecasting and disaster preparedness
  - Agro-processing, marketing, and market support
  - Agro-finance and farm business management
  - Government schemes
  - Localized farm-related information
