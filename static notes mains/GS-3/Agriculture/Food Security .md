**1. Introduction to Food Security**

According to the FAO's 2001 report, food security is when "all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for an active and healthy life."

The **World Summit on Food Security** identified **four pillars of food security**:

1. **Availability**: Sufficient food must be produced or accessible through imports or aid.
2. **Access**: People must have the economic and physical means to acquire food.
3. **Utilization**: Food must be used properly for nutrition, health, and well-being.
4. **Stability**: Food security should be maintained over time without disruptions from crises or natural disasters.

Food security requires not just the availability of food, but also the **purchasing power** to access it. Thus, ensuring food security involves addressing these four interconnected pillars to ensure consistent, nutritious, and affordable food for everyone.
