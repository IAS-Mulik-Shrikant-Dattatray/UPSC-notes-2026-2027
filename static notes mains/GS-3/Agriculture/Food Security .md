# Topic :  Food security



**1. Introduction to Food Security**

According to the FAO's 2001 report, food security is when "all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs for an active and healthy life."

The **World Summit on Food Security** identified **four pillars of food security**:

1. **Availability**: Sufficient food must be produced or accessible through imports or aid.
2. **Access**: People must have the economic and physical means to acquire food.
3. **Utilization**: Food must be used properly for nutrition, health, and well-being.
4. **Stability**: Food security should be maintained over time without disruptions from crises or natural disasters.

Food security requires not just the availability of food, but also the **purchasing power** to access it. Thus, ensuring food security involves addressing these four interconnected pillars to ensure consistent, nutritious, and affordable food for everyone.

**2. Food Security and the Constitution of India**

While the **Constitution of India** does not explicitly mention the right to food, the **right to life** under **Article 21** has been interpreted by the Supreme Court and the NHRC to include the **right to live with human dignity**, which encompasses the **right to food** and other basic necessities.

Additionally, **Article 47** (Directive Principles of State Policy) directs the state to prioritize **raising nutrition levels**, improving the **standard of living**, and enhancing **public health** as part of its fundamental duties.

**3. Qualitative and Quantitative Dimensions of Food Security**

Food security has two key dimensions:

1. **Quantitative Dimension**: This refers to the overall **food availability** in the economy.
2. **Qualitative Dimension**: This pertains to the **nutritional requirements** being met.

### Quantitative Dimension of Food Security in India
India became **self-sufficient** in food grains in the 1970s due to the **Green Revolution** and has maintained this since. For the **2023-2024** crop year, India's food grains production is estimated at **309.34 million tonnes (MT)**. India is self-sufficient in producing major food crops like **wheat** and **rice**, meeting per capita food needs.

**Per Capita Net Availability of Food Grain**:
- In **2014**, the availability was **489g/day**.
- It declined slightly to **484.3g/day** in **2018**.
- By **2022**, it increased to **514g/day**.

### Qualitative Dimension of Food Security in India
While food availability is sufficient, **distribution inequalities** and **disproportionate purchasing power** hinder the nutritional security of vulnerable groups. Key findings include:

- The **undernourished population** declined from **249.4 million** (2004-06) to **224.3 million** (2019-21).
- **Stunting in children** under 5 years dropped from **47.8%** (2012) to **34.7%** (2019).
- **Obesity in adults** grew from **25.2 million** (2012) to **70 million** (2023).
- **Anaemia in women** increased from **53%** (2015-16) to **57%** (2019-20); for men, it rose from **22.7%** to **25%.
- **Anaemia in children (6-59 months)** rose dramatically by **8.5%**, reaching **67.1%**.
- The percentage of infants exclusively breastfed grew from **55%** (2015-16) to **64%** (2019-21).
- India's **Global Hunger Index (2023)** ranks **113th** out of **125 countries**, behind **Bangladesh**, **Pakistan**, and **Nepal**.
