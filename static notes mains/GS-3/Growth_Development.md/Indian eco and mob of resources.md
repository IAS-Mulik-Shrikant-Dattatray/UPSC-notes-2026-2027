# Topic : Indian Economy and Mobilisation of Resources 

**1. Introduction:**

A resource is anything with utility or usability. The government needs human, physical, and economic resources to function. This document focuses on economic resources. Resource mobilization refers to the efficient collection and allocation of these resources to achieve a goal. Methods of mobilization include taxes, import/export duties, service fees, and borrowing.
