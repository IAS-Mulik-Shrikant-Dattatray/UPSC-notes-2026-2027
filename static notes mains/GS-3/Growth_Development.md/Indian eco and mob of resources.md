# Topic : Indian Economy and Mobilisation of Resources 

**1. Introduction:**

A resource is anything with utility or usability. The government needs human, physical, and economic resources to function. This document focuses on economic resources. Resource mobilization refers to the efficient collection and allocation of these resources to achieve a goal. Methods of mobilization include taxes, import/export duties, service fees, and borrowing.

 **2. Sources of Government’s Financial Resources**

 Mobilization of Resources:
Governments need human, physical, and economic resources to perform functions. In this context, mobilization refers to efficiently collecting and channeling financial resources.

 **2.1. Sources**  
1. **Tax Revenue**  
   - Direct taxes (e.g., income tax).  
   - Indirect taxes (e.g., GST, customs).  
2. **Non-Tax Revenue**  
   - Interest on bonds, loans.  
   - Dividends from PSUs.  
   - Grants and other non-tax income.  
3. **Capital Receipts**  
   - Borrowings (market loans, external borrowings, etc.).  
   - Loans from foreign governments and bodies.  
   - Proceeds from disinvestment.

 **2.2. Issues**  
1. **Distribution of Financial Resources**  
   - Imbalance between the center and states (horizontal and vertical).  
2. **Fiscal Consolidation**  
   - Difficulty in achieving FRBM targets (fiscal deficit and revenue deficit).  
3. **Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio**  
   - India’s tax-to-GDP ratio (11.6% for 2017–18) is significantly lower than other emerging markets and OECD nations.  
4. **Large Subsidy Burden**  
   - Subsidies on food, fertilizers, and fuel (major components).  
5. **Tax Avoidance and Evasion**  
   - Use of tax exemptions and evasion practices.

 **2.3. Steps Taken**  
1. **Reforms in Expenditure**  
   - Discontinuation of plan vs. non-plan expenditure classification.  
   - Merging General Budget and Railway Budget.  
   - Rationalizing subsidies through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) and other mechanisms.  
2. **Restructuring and Policy Adjustments**  
   - Restructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  
   - Addressing tax evasion via renegotiation of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAA).  
   - Long-term capital gains tax policy revision.

**3. Transfer of Resources from Center to States**


In the federal system of India, state and local bodies depend a lot on Center for meeting their financial requirements.

Mechanisms used to channel resources from the Central Government to the States in India. Here's a simplified and concise summary:

 **Mechanisms to Allocate Resources:**
1. **Finance Commission**:
   - Defines the principles for sharing taxes between the Union and the States.

2. **Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council**:
   - Recommends GST rates, exemptions, surcharges, rules, and special provisions (e.g., for North Eastern states).

3. **Grants-in-Aid** (Article 275 of the Constitution):
   - Provides financial assistance to states.

4. **Discretionary Grants** (Article 282):
   - Offers funds at the Union’s discretion for specific purposes. 

This structure ensures fair resource distribution based on constitutional provisions and fiscal recommendations.

**4. Issues in Mobilization of Resources:**

A. **Imbalance in Resource Distribution:** There is vertical imbalance (between the Centre and States) and horizontal imbalance (among states with varying fiscal capacities) in financial resource distribution.

B. **Fiscal Consolidation:** 
- From 2011-12 to 2019-20, the Union government's fiscal deficit stayed above the FRBM target, improving from 5.9% of GDP in 2011-12 to 3.4% in 2018-19, but rising again to 4.6% in 2019-20 and 9.22% in 2020-21 due to COVID-19-induced revenue declines.
- States performed better in meeting fiscal targets, maintaining deficits below 3% of GDP (except during 2015-17). However, state deficits rose to 4.53% in 2020-21 (RE).

C. **Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio:** India's tax-to-GDP ratio for 2023-24 is 11.6%, much lower than the OECD and emerging market averages. Reasons for this include:
- Low per capita income and rapid growth of tax exemptions.
- Lack of policy initiatives and tax exemptions for certain sectors.
- A small proportion of the population are taxpayers (2.2% in India vs. 50% in the US).
- Inefficient tax administration, corporate tax issues, and legal disputes reduce revenue.

D. **Inefficient Subsidy System:** India's subsidy system, especially for food, fertilizers, and fuel, is highly inefficient, and many needy people do not receive their due subsidies.

E. **Rising Tax Arrears:** The income tax department has Rs 11.1 lakh crore in arrears (as of 2017-18), hindered by issues like litigation, liquidation, and untraceable taxpayers.

F. **Corporate Tax Exemptions:** Despite a competitive corporate tax rate, India's effective tax rate is low due to numerous exemptions, which need rationalization.



NOTE : 

**NITI Aayog on Rationalizing Subsidies:**

- Social subsidies should focus on making people economically independent rather than creating dependency.
- Subsidies have crowded out critical spending on education and health within revenue expenditure.
- Subsidy targeting should improve by using socio-economic and caste census data.
- Production subsidies, such as cheap land and other benefits to companies, should be eliminated.
- Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) should be used in all social welfare schemes for more efficient distribution.

**Steps Taken by the Government:**

- Abolished plan and non-plan expenditure categories.
- Merged the General and Railways Budgets.
- Restructured Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS).
- Formed the N.K. Singh panel to review the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA) for fiscal consolidation.
- Rationalized subsidies through initiatives such as:
  - Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) via the Jan Dhan-Mobile-Aadhar trinity.
  - Switching to a nutrient-based subsidy scheme for fertilizers.
  - Eliminating fuel subsidies, except for LPG and Kerosene.
  - Freeing diesel and petrol prices.
  - Implementing the "Give-it-up" campaign and withdrawing LPG subsidies for high-income consumers.
  - Launching the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) plan.
- Reviewed Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects with steps like:
  - Establishing a strong institutional structure for appraising and approving PPPs.
  - Creating standardized documents, such as model concession agreements for infrastructure sectors.
  - Enhancing finance availability through dedicated institutions and viability gap funding.
  - Abolishing the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) since over 90% of FDI inflows are routed through the automatic route.
- Set up the National Land Monetisation Corporation (NLMC) to accelerate land and asset monetization in public sector entities.
