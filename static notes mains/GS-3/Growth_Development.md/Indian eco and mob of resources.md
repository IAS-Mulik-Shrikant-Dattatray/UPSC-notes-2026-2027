# Topic : Indian Economy and Mobilisation of Resources 

**1. Introduction:**

A resource is anything with utility or usability. The government needs human, physical, and economic resources to function. This document focuses on economic resources. Resource mobilization refers to the efficient collection and allocation of these resources to achieve a goal. Methods of mobilization include taxes, import/export duties, service fees, and borrowing.

 **2. Sources of Government’s Financial Resources**

 Mobilization of Resources:
Governments need human, physical, and economic resources to perform functions. In this context, mobilization refers to efficiently collecting and channeling financial resources.

 **2.1. Sources**  
1. **Tax Revenue**  
   - Direct taxes (e.g., income tax).  
   - Indirect taxes (e.g., GST, customs).  
2. **Non-Tax Revenue**  
   - Interest on bonds, loans.  
   - Dividends from PSUs.  
   - Grants and other non-tax income.

 **2.2. Issues**  
1. **Distribution of Financial Resources**  
   - Imbalance between the center and states (horizontal and vertical).  
2. **Fiscal Consolidation**  
   - Difficulty in achieving FRBM targets (fiscal deficit and revenue deficit).  
3. **Low Tax-to-GDP Ratio**  
   - India’s tax-to-GDP ratio (11.6% for 2017–18) is significantly lower than other emerging markets and OECD nations.  
4. **Large Subsidy Burden**  
   - Subsidies on food, fertilizers, and fuel (major components).  
5. **Tax Avoidance and Evasion**  
   - Use of tax exemptions and evasion practices.

   - Rationalizing subsidies through DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) and other mechanisms.  
2. **Restructuring and Policy Adjustments**  
   - Restructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.

**3. Transfer of Resources from Center to States**


In the federal system of India, state and local bodies depend a lot on Center for meeting their financial requirements.

Mechanisms used to channel resources from the Central Government to the States in India. Here's a simplified and concise summary:

 **Mechanisms to Allocate Resources:**
1. **Finance Commission**:
   - Defines the principles for sharing taxes between the Union and the States.

2. **Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council**:
   - Recommends GST rates, exemptions, surcharges, rules, and special provisions (e.g., for North Eastern states).

3. **Grants-in-Aid** (Article 275 of the Constitution):
   - Provides financial assistance to states.

4. **Discretionary Grants** (Article 282):
   - Offers funds at the Union’s discretion for specific purposes. 

This structure ensures fair resource distribution based on constitutional provisions and fiscal recommendations.
