**1. Inclusive Growth: Definition and Key Points**

Inclusive growth refers to economic growth that benefits all segments of society, ensuring fair distribution of prosperity, both in monetary and non-monetary terms. The OECD defines it as growth that creates opportunities for everyone and distributes its benefits equitably.

It supports the idea that wealth creation, economic freedom, and equal opportunity can coexist. Inclusive growth allows for long-term economic growth and well-being while ensuring freedom and equality.

While there is no universal definition globally, the UNDP sees it as a process where everyone can participate in growth and share its benefits. Though the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) don't explicitly mention inclusive growth, several goals promote its principles, including:

- **Goal 1**: End poverty by 2030.
- **Goal 2**: Achieve zero hunger by 2030.
- **Goal 3**: Reduce maternal and infant mortality rates by set targets.
- **Goal 4**: Ensure free, equitable, quality primary and secondary education for all by 2030.
- **Goal 4**: Equal access to affordable, quality education for all by 2030.
- **Goal 8**: Promote sustained per capita economic growth and reduce youth unemployment.
- **Goal 9**: Develop resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive industrialization.

Thus, inclusive growth is viewed in different ways depending on the agency, but all emphasize equitable participation and benefits.

**2. Dimensions of Inclusive Growth**

Inclusive growth is a pro-poor growth strategy where the poor not only benefit from economic growth but also actively participate in it. Key dimensions include:

- **Interdependence**: It acknowledges the connections between growth, gender, poverty, and the environment. These factors are integral to achieving inclusive growth.

**3. Need for Inclusive Growth in India**

Inclusive growth is crucial for India to address key challenges, particularly poverty. 


**3.1 Poverty :** 

- **Poverty Reduction**: According to NITI Aayog, India has made significant progress in reducing multidimensional poverty, from 29.17% in 2013-14 to 11.28% in 2022-23, lifting 24.82 crore people out of poverty. India is likely to meet its SDG target of halving poverty before 2030. However, economic growth alone hasn't guaranteed inclusive growth, highlighting the need for policies beyond growth promotion.

- **Impact of Economic Reforms on Poverty**: 
  - **Growth-Oriented Approach**: Economic growth was expected to spread benefits across society, trickling down to the poor.
  - **Poverty Alleviation Programs**: These were introduced during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-66) and expanded over time.
  - **Post-1990 Reforms**: Economic reforms and self-help groups have contributed to poverty reduction.
  
  - **Trends in Poverty**: Poverty declined faster after 1991, particularly in urban areas. The Tendulkar and Rangarajan Committees reported significant poverty reduction, with 138 million people lifted out of poverty between 2004-2009.

**3.2. Inequality**


**Inequality in India**

Inequality in India has worsened since the 1980s, particularly accelerating after the early 2000s. Between 2014-15 and 2022-23, wealth concentration at the top end increased significantly.

- **Income and Wealth Inequality**: 
  - India’s income and wealth inequality is among the highest globally. In 2022-23, the top 1% held 22.6% of the income and 40.1% of the wealth, while the bottom 50% earned only 15% of the national income, down from 20.6% in 1951.
  
- **Social Inequality**: 
  - Gender and caste-based inequities are prominent. For instance, male workers earn significantly more than female workers across different employment types. 
  - **Periodic Labour Force Survey (2019-2023)**: In 2023, male self-employed workers earned 2.8 times more than women, and male casual workers earned 48% more.

- **Emerging Inequalities**: 
  - Inequalities are deepening due to the climate crisis and technological advancements. For example, countries with high human development are seeing faster growth in tertiary education compared to low human development nations.

**Consequences of Inequality**:

- **Low Social Mobility**: Extreme inequality limits social mobility, making it harder for children from poor families to escape poverty due to lack of education, skills, and assets.
- **Democratic Undermining**: High inequality fosters corruption, cronyism, and social unrest, and may fuel authoritarianism.
- **Climate Crisis Impact**: Poorer communities are less equipped to handle climate change, and income inequality can hinder the spread of eco-friendly technologies.
- **Political Inequality**: Economic inequality often translates into political power imbalances, weakening institutional effectiveness and policy implementation.

To reduce inequality, there is a need for better access to health, education, financial inclusion, and equal opportunities for all.

**3.3. Unemployment :**

**Unemployment in India**

Unemployment and underemployment rates in India rose until 2018 but have since declined. The overall unemployment rate dropped from 6% in 2018 to 3.2% in 2023, with youth unemployment also decreasing from 17.8% to 10% in the same period.

- **Youth Unemployment**: Despite overall improvements, youth unemployment remains a key challenge. Increasing educational attainment has led to a rise in unemployment among educated youth, who now make up two-thirds of total unemployment. For example, in 2023, the unemployment rate for graduates and above was 28%, down from 35.4% in 2019, with women facing higher rates.

- **Jobless Growth**: While some claim India’s growth is "jobless," data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) shows decreasing unemployment rates in the past five years.

**Youth Underemployment**: Despite the decline in unemployment, underemployment remains a serious issue due to several factors:
- **Social Pressure**: Overpopulation and societal expectations push people to take jobs below their skill levels.
- **Technological Advances**: Machines and technology replace entry-level jobs, rendering existing skills obsolete.
- **Underutilization of Human Capital**: The lack of high-productivity jobs results in the underuse of the workforce's potential.
- **Skills Gap**: Insufficient on-the-job training and outdated skills development lead to inefficiencies.
- **Mediocrity**: Limited access to quality jobs discourages skill development, contributing to unemployment.
- **Other Issues**: Brain drain, low self-esteem, lack of motivation, and emotional challenges like stress, depression, and hypertension exacerbate the problem.

**Conclusion**: To address these challenges, India needs to create high-productivity, high-wage jobs that fully utilize the workforce’s skills.

**4.  Challenges to Inclusive Growth in India**

Despite efforts to address poverty, inequality, and unemployment, India faces several structural and socio-economic challenges hindering progress towards inclusive growth:

- **Poverty**: While 24.82 crore people have escaped multidimensional poverty in the last nine years, about 11% of the population remains multidimensionally poor.

- **Unequal Distribution of Resources**: Wealth, land, and education are concentrated among a few, limiting opportunities for the rest. In 2022-23, the top 1% held 22.6% of the income and 40.1% of the wealth.

- **Social and Cultural Barriers**: Discrimination based on caste, gender, religion, and other factors restricts access to education, employment, and healthcare for many.

- **Regional Disparities**: Economic growth is uneven, with some states thriving while others lag behind.

- **Agriculture Struggles**: Agriculture employs many but contributes less to GDP, facing low productivity, limited irrigation, and climate vulnerability.

- **Informal Sector Reliance**: A large part of India’s workforce is in the informal sector, which offers lower wages and limited social safety nets.

- **Skill Gaps**: The education system often fails to equip people with the skills needed for the modern job market.

- **Automation**: Technological advancements, such as robotics, could render many jobs obsolete, with up to 800 million people worldwide expected to be displaced by 2030.

- **Corruption**: Corruption, red tape, and lack of transparency remain significant obstacles, as reflected in India's rank of 93 out of 180 countries in the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index.

Addressing these challenges is crucial for fostering inclusive growth and improving human capital in India, yielding long-term benefits.

**7.  Strategies to Achieve Inclusive Growth**

**7.1. Universal Basic Income (UBI)**  
Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a proposed strategy to ensure inclusive growth by providing regular, unconditional cash payments to all individuals, regardless of their income or employment status. It aims to alleviate poverty, reduce inequality, and promote social welfare. The key characteristics of UBI are:

1. **Periodic Payments**: UBI is provided at regular intervals (e.g., monthly or annually), ensuring a stable and predictable source of income for individuals.
2. **Cash Payment**: The benefit is delivered in cash, not in-kind or vouchers. This allows recipients the flexibility to spend the money according to their needs, empowering them to make their own economic choices.
3. **Individual Focus**: Payments are made to individuals rather than households or families, ensuring that each person receives the benefit directly.
4. **Universal Access**: UBI is available to all individuals within the economy, irrespective of their socio-economic status, thus promoting equity and inclusion.
5. **Unconditional**: The cash payment is unconditional, meaning it is provided without any requirement for employment status, income level, or other conditions. This ensures that even marginalized or unemployed individuals can benefit.

UBI is seen as a way to reduce poverty, enhance social security, and address inequality, making it a potential tool for promoting inclusive growth in India.

**7.10 Reforms in MGNREGA Summary**

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is a flagship rural employment program aimed at providing employment opportunities to rural households. Recent reforms in the MGNREGA scheme have focused on improving wage payments, creating durable assets, and addressing challenges such as low wages and underemployment.

### **Key Reforms and Benefits:**

1. **Linking Wages to Inflation (CPI-Rural):**
   - The government plans to link MGNREGA wages to an updated inflation index (CPI-Rural), which will be revised annually to adjust wages in line with inflation.

2. **Transparency and Payment Reforms:**
   - 100% geo-tagging of assets, AADHAAR linking of bank accounts, IT/DBT transfers for wages, and material payments.
   - Geographic Information System (GIS)-based planning for better project monitoring.

3. **Durable Asset Creation:**
   - **60:40 Wage-Material Ratio Shift:** The wage-material ratio was previously set at the Gram Panchayat level, often leading to the creation of non-productive assets. It has now been shifted to the district level, allowing flexibility for more productive assets.
   - Focus on creating community and individual beneficiary assets like farm ponds, dairy sheds, Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), and solid waste management infrastructure. These assets have improved livelihoods and infrastructure in rural areas.

4. **Water Conservation Mission:**
   - Special focus on areas with falling groundwater levels through the Mission Water Conservation Guidelines (2015-16).
   - Collaboration with the Central Ground Water Board for technical support and the rollout of the Barefoot Technicians program to enhance technical supervision of water conservation projects.

### **Challenges Associated with MGNREGA:**

1. **Low Wages:**
   - The national average wage for MGNREGA workers is ₹178.44 per day, which is below the national minimum wage (₹375 per day).
   - Wage disparity exists across states, with some paying higher wages (₹375/day) and others paying much lower (e.g., Uttar Pradesh at ₹182/day).

2. **Wage Revision Method:**
   - MGNREGA wages are linked to the Consumer Price Index for Agriculture Labour (CPI-AL), which is considered problematic and not aligned with broader inflation trends.

3. **Underemployment:**
   - The average number of days of employment provided per household is relatively low (around 50 days per year), indicating underemployment.

4. **Administrative Challenges:**
   - Workers are penalized for administrative lapses, such as delayed submission of fund statements or other documents, which leads to withheld wages.

5. **Centralization Weakening Local Governance:**
   - The shift to a centralized payment and real-time monitoring system has reduced the role of Panchayati Raj Institutions in implementation, monitoring, and grievance redressal.

### **Initiatives to Streamline MGNREGA:**

1. **NREGAsoft:**
   - An e-Governance system that enables rural workers to access essential documents like muster rolls and job cards in local languages, improving transparency and efficiency.

2. **GeoMGNREGA:**
   - Uses space technology for geo-tagging assets created under MGNREGA, enabling online tracking and monitoring of project progress.

3. **Mobile Apps for Increased Accountability:**
   - Apps like Gram Samvaad and JanMnREGA provide rural citizens with direct access to information, improving accountability and enabling citizens to track assets and report issues.

4. **Project LIFE-MGNREGA:**
   - The "Livelihood In Full Employment" project aims to enhance the skill base of MGNREGA workers, helping them transition from partial to full employment and increasing self-reliance.

### **Conclusion:**
MGNREGA reforms focus on improving transparency, accountability, and the creation of durable, income-generating assets. However, challenges like low wages, underemployment, and centralization persist. Initiatives like digital platforms, skill-building projects, and revised wage structures are steps toward improving the program's effectiveness in providing meaningful rural employment.

### Extra : 

**1. A resilient and prosperous MSME sector is essential for making a big impact on India’s inclusive growth story. Discuss in context of the issues faced by the sector.**


The MSME sector is vital for India's inclusive growth, contributing significantly to the economy. It accounts for 45% of manufacturing output, 40% of exports, about one-third of GDP, and employs around 11.1 crore people, making it the backbone of the economy.

**MSMEs and Inclusive Growth:**
- **Employment Generation**: MSMEs are the second-largest employment providers in India after agriculture, with a labor intensity four times higher than large industries.
- **Regional Dispersal**: MSMEs are spread across the country, including rural areas, contributing to regional economic growth and reducing dependence on agriculture.
- **Entrepreneurship**: Many MSMEs are owned by vulnerable sections, fostering inclusive entrepreneurship.

**Challenges Faced by MSMEs:**
1. **Infrastructure Bottlenecks**: Poor infrastructure limits business operations and growth.
2. **Access to Credit**: Most MSMEs are informal, making credit access difficult and hindering growth.
3. **Delayed Payments**: MSMEs often face delayed payments from larger industries, affecting cash flow and operations. Despite legal protections, they hesitate to enforce penalties due to power imbalances.
4. **Competition**: Lack of innovation and use of outdated technologies reduce the sector's competitiveness.

**Government Initiatives**:
The government has introduced schemes like SFURTI, ASPIRE, Credit Guarantee Fund, and CLCSS to support MSMEs. However, further reforms, including the implementation of recommendations from the U.K. Sinha committee, are needed to strengthen the MSME sector.

**2. Access to land and effective control over it are crucial for inclusive growth and poverty eradication in India. Elaborate. Also, discuss the land reform measures adopted in India in recent times to ensure inclusive growth.**

In India, landlessness remains a significant issue. According to the 2011 Socio-Economic Caste Census, 56.41% of rural households were landless. The 2013 Draft National Land Reforms Policy also noted that 31% of households have no land. 

**Importance of Access to Land for Inclusive Growth:**
- **Poverty Reduction**: With 54.6% of India’s workforce in agriculture, secure land rights incentivize investment, provide better credit access, and offer a safety net during shocks. Land ownership can also break the cycle of inter-generational poverty by enabling investments in children's development.
- **Inclusive Growth**: Land ownership creates income-generating opportunities, empowering women and marginalized groups by providing security, a stronger voice, and protection against economic and environmental risks.

**Recent Land Reforms in India:**
India has introduced several measures to improve land access:
- **Digital India Land Record Modernisation Program (DILRMP)** (2016): Aimed at updating land records, digitizing surveys, and resolving disputes.
- **Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN)** (2021): Provides a 14-digit ID for each land parcel to ensure accurate land records.
- **SVAMITVA Scheme** (2020): Uses modern tech to map rural residential land and issue property cards to recognized owners.
- **LARR Act** (2013): Ensures fair compensation, transparency, and rehabilitation for those displaced by land acquisition.
- **Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act** (2016): Recognizes tenant farmers and improves their access to institutional credit.
- **Model Contract Farming Act** (2018): Protects farmers’ rights and limits land rights transfer in contract farming.

The NITI Aayog's Draft Model Act on Conclusive Land Titling (2019) is also under discussion. As land reforms are a state subject, their success depends on state-level implementation, with Karnataka’s Bhoomi project serving as a successful example for wider adoption.

**3. Do you agree that high economic growth in the post-reform period has not resulted in growth trickling down to the marginalised sections, rendering inclusive growth a major concern? Justify your answer.**


Since the 1991 economic reforms, India has experienced impressive growth. The GDP surged from $270 billion in 1991 to $3.2 trillion in 2021, and per capita income grew at an 11.2% annual rate between 1991 and 2019. Despite this growth, poor inclusive growth remains a significant issue:

**Concerns about Inclusive Growth:**
- **Economic Inequality**: India is one of the fastest-growing economies, but also one of the most unequal. The top 10% of the population holds 77% of the nation's wealth (Oxfam report).
- **Jobless Growth**: Despite economic growth, job creation has been minimal. Employment grew by only 1.04% annually from 1991 to 2017, with many still in low-income jobs in agriculture and the informal sector.
- **Low Human Development**: India ranked 132nd on the UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI) in 2021, with an average score of 0.633, below the global average of 0.732.
- **Multidimensional Poverty**: Around 16.4% of the population lives in multidimensional poverty, with 18.7% at risk, highlighting ongoing economic exclusion.
- **Limited Upward Mobility**: Despite liberalization, opportunities for upward mobility remain limited for disadvantaged groups based on gender, caste, and religion.
- **Children’s Well-being**: The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5) found that 35.5% of children are stunted, 19.3% are wasted, and 32.1% are underweight.
- **Gender Inequality**: Women's household responsibilities reduce their participation in the labor market. India ranked 135th out of 146 countries in the 2022 Global Gender Gap Index.

**Recommendation**: To foster inclusive growth, India must prioritize investments in primary and vocational education, health infrastructure, job creation, and financial services. In agricultural states, establishing local industries, processing units, and improving infrastructure like storage and transportation can also promote inclusive growth.

**4. Examine the relation between health and poverty. Discuss how inclusive healthcare can ensure inclusive growth for India.**

In recent years, India has reduced its multidimensional poverty from 24.85% in 2015-16 to 14.96% in 2019-2021. It has also decreased out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) from 62.6% in 2014-15 to 47.1% in 2019-20. However, India still has one of the highest poverty rates in the world.

**The Relationship Between Health and Poverty:**
- **Ill Health and Poverty**: Poor health reduces productivity and limits economic opportunities, which perpetuates poverty. With only 2.1% of GDP spent on public health, many households face catastrophic health expenses, impoverishing over 55 million people annually.
- **Poverty and Ill Health**: Poverty often limits access to clean water, sanitation, and nutritious food, increasing the risk of diseases and chronic health issues, which further entrench poverty.

**Inclusive Healthcare for Inclusive Growth:**
- **Reduction of Inequality**: Affordable healthcare helps reduce inequality, especially for marginalized groups like Dalits and Tribals, by lowering OOPE and stabilizing long-term consumption.
  - Example: The Affordable Care Act in the USA reduced income inequality between racial/ethnic groups.
- **Empowering Women**: Access to maternal and reproductive healthcare enhances women’s workforce participation and decision-making power.
  - Example: In the Nordic region, comprehensive healthcare services for women have helped achieve a high employment rate of 73.5%.
- **Balanced Regional Development**: Inclusive healthcare can bridge rural-urban disparities, fostering balanced development.
  - Example: Kerala’s emphasis on inclusive healthcare has contributed to its inclusive growth.
- **Children's Progress**: Addressing malnutrition and diseases improves children’s education and future earning potential. Stunted children earn 20% less as adults.
- **Reducing Employment Barriers**: Healthcare access can support individuals with disabilities, improving their employment prospects and contributing to inclusive growth.

To meet SDG 3, India is increasing its healthcare spending, particularly through the Ayushman Bharat Scheme, to promote inclusive growth.
