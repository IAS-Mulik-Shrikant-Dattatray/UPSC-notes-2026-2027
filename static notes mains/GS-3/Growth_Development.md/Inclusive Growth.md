**1. Inclusive Growth: Definition and Key Points**

Inclusive growth refers to economic growth that benefits all segments of society, ensuring fair distribution of prosperity, both in monetary and non-monetary terms. The OECD defines it as growth that creates opportunities for everyone and distributes its benefits equitably.

It supports the idea that wealth creation, economic freedom, and equal opportunity can coexist. Inclusive growth allows for long-term economic growth and well-being while ensuring freedom and equality.

While there is no universal definition globally, the UNDP sees it as a process where everyone can participate in growth and share its benefits. Though the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) don't explicitly mention inclusive growth, several goals promote its principles, including:

- **Goal 1**: End poverty by 2030.
- **Goal 2**: Achieve zero hunger by 2030.
- **Goal 3**: Reduce maternal and infant mortality rates by set targets.
- **Goal 4**: Ensure free, equitable, quality primary and secondary education for all by 2030.
- **Goal 4**: Equal access to affordable, quality education for all by 2030.
- **Goal 8**: Promote sustained per capita economic growth and reduce youth unemployment.
- **Goal 9**: Develop resilient infrastructure and promote inclusive industrialization.

Thus, inclusive growth is viewed in different ways depending on the agency, but all emphasize equitable participation and benefits.

**2. Dimensions of Inclusive Growth**

Inclusive growth is a pro-poor growth strategy where the poor not only benefit from economic growth but also actively participate in it. Key dimensions include:

- **Interdependence**: It acknowledges the connections between growth, gender, poverty, and the environment. These factors are integral to achieving inclusive growth.

**3. Need for Inclusive Growth in India**

Inclusive growth is crucial for India to address key challenges, particularly poverty. 


**3.1 Poverty :** 

- **Poverty Reduction**: According to NITI Aayog, India has made significant progress in reducing multidimensional poverty, from 29.17% in 2013-14 to 11.28% in 2022-23, lifting 24.82 crore people out of poverty. India is likely to meet its SDG target of halving poverty before 2030. However, economic growth alone hasn't guaranteed inclusive growth, highlighting the need for policies beyond growth promotion.

- **Impact of Economic Reforms on Poverty**: 
  - **Growth-Oriented Approach**: Economic growth was expected to spread benefits across society, trickling down to the poor.
  - **Poverty Alleviation Programs**: These were introduced during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-66) and expanded over time.
  - **Post-1990 Reforms**: Economic reforms and self-help groups have contributed to poverty reduction.
  
  - **Trends in Poverty**: Poverty declined faster after 1991, particularly in urban areas. The Tendulkar and Rangarajan Committees reported significant poverty reduction, with 138 million people lifted out of poverty between 2004-2009.

- **Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2023**: 
  - The Global MPI measures poverty based on deprivations in health, education, and living standards, tracking both the incidence and intensity of poverty.
  - NITI Aayog plans to use this index for monitoring India’s performance and driving reforms to improve social and economic conditions, ensuring more effective implementation of government policies.

**3.2. Inequality**


**Inequality in India**

Inequality in India has worsened since the 1980s, particularly accelerating after the early 2000s. Between 2014-15 and 2022-23, wealth concentration at the top end increased significantly.

- **Income and Wealth Inequality**: 
  - India’s income and wealth inequality is among the highest globally. In 2022-23, the top 1% held 22.6% of the income and 40.1% of the wealth, while the bottom 50% earned only 15% of the national income, down from 20.6% in 1951.
  
- **Social Inequality**: 
  - Gender and caste-based inequities are prominent. For instance, male workers earn significantly more than female workers across different employment types. 
  - **Periodic Labour Force Survey (2019-2023)**: In 2023, male self-employed workers earned 2.8 times more than women, and male casual workers earned 48% more.

- **Emerging Inequalities**: 
  - Inequalities are deepening due to the climate crisis and technological advancements. For example, countries with high human development are seeing faster growth in tertiary education compared to low human development nations.

**Consequences of Inequality**:

- **Low Social Mobility**: Extreme inequality limits social mobility, making it harder for children from poor families to escape poverty due to lack of education, skills, and assets.
- **Democratic Undermining**: High inequality fosters corruption, cronyism, and social unrest, and may fuel authoritarianism.
- **Climate Crisis Impact**: Poorer communities are less equipped to handle climate change, and income inequality can hinder the spread of eco-friendly technologies.
- **Political Inequality**: Economic inequality often translates into political power imbalances, weakening institutional effectiveness and policy implementation.

To reduce inequality, there is a need for better access to health, education, financial inclusion, and equal opportunities for all.
